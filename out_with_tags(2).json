Supported by a faculty team with diverse researching and in-field experiences, the curriculum combines both theory and applied practice to provide an interdisciplinary and lived experience for learners. Emphasis is strongly placed on exploring systemic discriminations of crime and the experiences of marginalized groups, psychological understandings of offending, and current social justice issues.\nIn the first year of study, students participate in a social science foundational year with their peers from the Faculty of Social  Community Services. In years two through four, the curriculum has a criminal justice focus. Knowledge and critical skills will be developed through collaborative group projects and presentations to help prepare for a variety of fast-paced and dynamic work settings within the justice field. Students will also complete a work-integrated learning credit (offered part-time or full-time). This networking opportunity fosters the development of practical skills among our learners.\nHumber\u2019s multidisciplinary teaching approach emphasizes critical thinking, analytical, organizational, research and strong writing skills. These are combined with the development of professional skills including communication, interpersonal skills, conflict management, problem solving, team building and leadership.",

Applied behavioural analysis uses behavioural rules in everyday situations to help people change their behaviour to improve quality of life. The program focuses on data obtained through observation as it investigates behaviour, cognitive events and the influence of environmental factors on behaviour.\nCourses in the first two years of the program provide a strong foundation in behaviour analytic approaches, psychology, research and ethics while highlighting specific special populations. This is followed in the final two years by further in-depth study of ethics and professionalism, individual and group counselling, issues in behavioural psychology, further special populations, and two courses of senior thesis work. Overall, the program emphasizes critical thinking, analytical skills, interprofessional practice and leadership.",

Following the first year, the curriculum branches into three different discipline areas: Information Systems Engineering, Mechatronics, and The Built Environment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Bachelor of Engineering \u2013 Mechatronics discipline gives you hands-on experience with industry-standard advanced technology. You can choose from focused study in either robotics or embedded systems.\u00a0During the course of\u00a0the program, students will solve real industry and community problems and gain knowledge and skills in mechanical, electrical, electronics and computer engineering. Students use emerging and\u00a0cutting edge\u00a0technologies in robotics, control, electronics, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), motors, mechanical components, digital and analog circuits, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), machine learning, modelling, simulation, embedded systems, and advanced manufacturing. Each of these themes provides theoretical knowledge alongside hands-on training to complement a systems-thinking approach to solving real world problems.\u00a0\nIn addition, this program provides an opportunity to work on industry-led projects through multidisciplinary capstone projects as well as applied research opportunities. Through these experiences, students apply the theoretical knowledge gained during their education to solve real industry problems, while improving their professional skills such as teamwork, communication, collaboration and problem-solving.\u00a0\nThis program is also offered at\u00a0Sault College in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Students\u00a0in the program will collaborate on activities using technology that will involve simultaneous learning at both colleges.",

You\u2019ve been called \u201ctalented.\u201d You do stuff like write, draw, paint, design posters, dance, play music, DJ, take cool photos, do stand-up comedy, shoot your own videos, create animated GIFs. You like to make things and get stuff done. You\u2019re the one who organizes the stage crew and the Talent Night. Maybe you\u2019ve already done some other study \u2013 anthropology, English, history, psychology, graphic design, photography. And you\u2019re wondering: \u201cCan I make a career out of any of this?\u201d\nWe certainly think so. How about art director, copywriter, strategist, or account executive in the world of advertising \u2013 probably the most fun business you can be in while actually being paid (well) to be creative.\nIn Humber\u2019s Bachelor of Creative Advertising program, you\u2019ll work hard. You\u2019ll get a lot of depth and theory, but you\u2019ll do even more hands-on work that puts that theory to real-world use. You'll build skills you never knew you had. You\u2019ll have fun. You\u2019ll meet lifelong friends and creative collaborators who will become the core of your future professional network. You\u2019ll mix and work with industry professionals, build a killer portfolio, and launch your career with a 14-week internship \u2013 probably at one of the better agencies in the country.\nThe program provides a unique, 360-degree education in the key aspects of modern advertising: art direction, copywriting, account management and creative strategy. Over the four years of the degree, this allows you to discover your own particular creative strengths and identify your ideal career path while working in industry-standard teams and learning how to develop powerful, effective advertising campaigns.\nAt its core, the Bachelor of Creative Advertising program is designed to build future industry leaders, and we do.

Communications studies are becoming recognized as one of the most significant social sciences in the 21st century. Increasingly, worldviews are shaped through messages received from television, film, the internet, social media and a host of media arts, with profound impacts on how the world and the self are viewed. The construction of everyday lives and identities are negotiated through digital media and social networks which influence how we live, the products we produce and consume, and how we connect.\nThis program is rigorous and innovative, developing digital storytellers who are skilled in writing, visual communication, web applications and social media. You will build business acumen while working in an environment where creative ideas and methods cross-pollinate. As you gain technical competency, you will collaborate and innovate with peers, faculty and visitors, building personal communication and networking skills. Intensive lectures and labs provide direction and practical experience, sharpening technical skills and stimulating critical discourse, using student work as a starting point. Access to equipment and computing spaces enables reflective and collaborative project work. Historical, legal, ethical and theoretical considerations are built into the creative process.\nAs part of the program, you will take courses that deepen your awareness of your roles as a citizen conscious of the social, political, environmental and cultural contexts of your work. As a senior student in this program, you will specialize in advanced communication theory and techniques. A culminating capstone project showcases your abilities and learning and serves as a platform for launching a career in social media co-ordination and management, digital content creation, media relations and many other mass communications fields. Graduates may also choose to further their studies at the master\u2019s level.",

These skills include sketching, digital graphic rendering, model-making and computer-aided design (CAD).\u00a0\nThe program is project driven, and many of the design projects will involve industry collaboration to ensure real-world relevance.\nStudents elect a design specialization in Year 3 in one of:\n\ntransportations design\nproduct design\u00a0\ninteraction design\n\nTransportations designers design the appearance (styling) of motor vehicles including automobiles, motorcycles and off-road vehicles. Humber is the only industrial design program in Canada that offers a transportations design specialization.\u00a0\nIn product design, there is more emphasis on the method of finding a solution to a user\u2019s problem in order to make doing a task easier or make the user experience with the product more satisfying.\nInteraction design is a new offering in the program which recognizes that more and more physical products are integrating a digital component, including touch screens or voice activation.",

Through this hands-on learning process, students will develop the fundamental creative and technical multimedia design and development capabilities needed to pursue a career in user experience (UX) design, user interface (UI) design, product design, videography, motion graphics, and front-end development.\u00a0\nMultimedia Design and Development is one of two programs within Humber\u2019s interaction and design common platform cluster. The first semester of this program is shared with the three-year Graphic Design program. This offers students exposure to the different areas of programming, common elements of design and creative thinking, and collaborative work with students studying to work in complementary career fields. Greater exposure to the ever-evolving exciting world of design and development will allow students to investigate the edges of this area of study, and then students will confirm their focus prior to the second semester of study.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnder the guidance of experienced and knowledgeable professors, students learn on and become experienced with industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, XD, Audition and Premiere. Web technologies such as HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS and MongoDB are employed in hands-on learning situations in our applied teaching environment with relevant industry projects.\u00a0\nStudents cultivate important collaborative teamwork and project management skills through group assignments both within this program and through interdisciplinary work with students in sister programs. This prepares students for collaborative projects in the field and helps students gain a real-world perspective on the nature of multimedia work. Students prepare to pursue new media opportunities by developing a comprehensive portfolio that they can present to potential employers or clients, and they are exposed to entrepreneurial opportunities open to professionals in this rich field. Students in this program also build real-world user experience skills using Humber\u2019s unique, mobile usability lab and through a work placement.",

Our students are in demand by employers across the country and beyond.\nWhat sets PRD apart is the common first semester which exposes students to complementary communications disciplines in their first semester of study: advertising, marketing, graphic design and journalism. Students can remain in PRD or move into another area of study if they choose.\nPRD prepares students for this demanding, deadline-driven career through foundational courses and practical, hands-on experience. As students move into the following semesters, the focus is on creating and executing effective communications strategies through a selection of tactics that resonate with the target audiences. Full-time faculty and part-time instructors (who continue to work in the industry) assist students to hone their skills in practical courses in four PR Writing Labs, strategic communications planning, social and digital media content development/analytics, media relations, research, PR agency, public affairs and issues/crisis management. The successful completion of this course work culminates in an internship.",
