Pairing\u00a0 these two disciplines provides an ideal framework to explore how society and culture influence your perspective, biases, and worldview.\nIn your first and second year, you explore foundational sociology and anthropology concepts. You reflect on what it means to be human: A look at life in a hunting band or a Himalayan village brings life in your city into new focus. Investigating the challenges facing indigenous and Third World peoples helps you become a better world citizen.\nIn your third and fourth year, you tackle in-depth courses. You examine the ideas of famous theorists, discuss contemporary issues such as globalization and social change, and learn the skills to conduct quantitative and qualitative research and analysis. Throughout your degree, you build an appreciation for Canadian diversity and First Nations cultures.\nBy the end of your degree, you have gained a broad understanding of your society, sharpened your cross-cultural skills, and developed sought-after research, analysis, and writing skills.\nView program outline in the UFV Academic Calendar.\nAdditional opportunities:\nYour degree offers a 6-credit course to gain relevant workplace experience in both Sociology and Anthropology. Work with the Canadian government, a non-governmental organization, or other related business, apply what you learned in the classroom, and gain valuable work experience.\nGet involved in the Sociology Anthropology Undergraduate Society.\u00a0 SAUS is a student run organization which works to promote the professional and educational pursuits of its members through informational seminars, public discussion panels, weekly gathering and ongoing student events.\nAnthropology minor/extended minor\nInvestigate the lore and logic of other cultures and gain a framework for looking critically at your own through an Anthropology minor or extended minor.\u00a0\nIn your first and second year, you build your knowledge of social research, the anthropology of world religions, and the traditional culture of the First Nations people of British Columbia. You investigate the challenges facing indigenous and third world populations and become an informed global citizen. In your third and fourth year, you focus on your interests by choosing 16 credits from a selection of upper-level courses. Take your pick from courses that explore identity, power in global societies, culture and more.\u00a0\nCombine your Anthropology minor or extended minor with a complementary discipline such as sociology, political science, or history to complete your degree. By the end of your studies, you are enabled with a toolkit of skills to think critically regarding topics of culture and society, both locally and globally.\nAdditional opportunities\nBuild your professional network, attend student events, and be a student leader by joining the Sociology Anthropology Undergraduate Society.",

You will learn about resource management, sustainability research, and innovative problem-solving. You will also learn how to communicate your research and ideas effectively.\nThe BES (Natural Sciences) is designed to be interdisciplinary. It will help you create connections between several career-building subjects: geography, biology, philosophy, agriculture, economics, communications, and more. You will specialize in the natural sciences by completing upper-level science courses that include lab and fieldwork across the Fraser Valley region, enabling you to pursue professional accreditation after graduation.\nCourses are delivered in both online and face-to-face formats, using lecture, seminar, field-based, and technology-supported classroom experiences.\nYour program also includes a practical work experience component. You can meet this requirement through a practicum or by joining the cooperative education program. Gaining such real-world experience will enhance your technical skill sets and help build your job-ready qualifications.\nAfter you graduate, you will be equipped to work in the field of environmental science or as an environmental professional in Canada or abroad. You may also choose to pursue graduate studies.\nIf you are interested in a program that offers more elective credits, UFV also offers the Bachelor of Environmental Studies (BES).\u00a0\nView program outline",

After you complete your training, Transport Canada will\u00a0assess you and award you Aviation licenses and ratings that allow you to fly a variety of aircraft in varying conditions. With these certifications complete, you'll receive academic credit towards your UFV business diploma. You can complete your certifications either before, during, or after your business courses, and you have the freedom to switch flight schools if needed.\nView program outline in the UFV Academic Calendar.\nAdditional opportunities\nStarting in Fall 2022, aviation diploma students can build on-the-job skills by participating in the Co-operative education option. Combine study semesters with four- eight, or twelve-month paid work terms, offered in regional, national, and global firms. Positions are available in business settings (not pilot roles).

By sharpening your attention to detail, learn how to interpret the evidence found in various works of visual art, architecture, fashion, and design.\nIn your first and second year, you are introduced to the wide collection of art produced during time periods ranging from prehistory to the present, while considering their historical and cultural contexts.\nIn your third and fourth year, you discover the wealth of visual art during major eras of history such as, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, pre and post-World War II, as well as the present. Delve into topics such as the rise of art academies, art theory, religious conflict, colonial expansion, and museum practices.\nProgram fieldwork includes touring local collections, with opportunities to travel to regional and international galleries and museums.\nBy the end of the program, you are equipped with the vocabulary and historical savvy to analyze the breadth of visual art created throughout history.\n\nView the program requirements for the minor and extended minor in the UFV Academic Calendar.\nView art history course descriptions in the UFV Academic Calendar.",
