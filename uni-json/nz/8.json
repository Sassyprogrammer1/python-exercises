Our graduates work in many countries including the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the UK, and Asia.\nGreat facilities\nMassey University is the veterinary school for the whole of New Zealand. So it is a key focus for Massey University and we have some of the best facilities in Australasia. You can see some of them in our Behind the Scenes virtual tour.\u00a0We\u2019re also currently building more great facilities that will make our future veterinary students\u2019 learning experience even better.\nDegree structure overview\nOur Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc), is a five-year (10 semester) qualification offered solely on the Manawat\u016b campus in Palmerston North. The first semester (starting in February) is referred to as the \u2018pre-selection\u2019 semester. Depending on your performance in the pre-selection semester courses and selection assessments, you may be selected to the \u2018professional phase\u2019 (4.5 years long) beginning in July. Selection is competitive so it pays to come well prepared for the pre-selection semester.\u00a0 Make sure you work on your communication and interpersonal skills and get a good background in the sciences before joining us.\nProfessional veterinary training\nIf you\u2019re selected into the professional phase, you\u2019ll be well trained in a broad range of animal species. You\u2019ll get hands-on experiences from day one and develop problem-solving skills, while learning everything you need to work as a veterinarian. You\u2019ll spend the final year on clinical placements and have the opportunity to focus more in an area of interest. In line with the international recognition of this degree, you will find the study rigorous, challenging and interesting.\nInternational students\nMany international students study veterinary science with Massey. We understand it takes a special kind of person to choose to complete their veterinary degree abroad and we welcome you to join us.\nFast track your veterinary career\nIn New Zealand, professional training qualifications (like medicine, vet and law) are undergraduate degrees, so you don\u2019t need a previous degree to study. Whether you\u2019ve recently completed high school or have already done a couple of years or even a degree at university, you can join us to become a veterinarian in a total of five years or less.\nThe Massey veterinary degree is one of the fastest paths to becoming a fully qualified veterinarian, who is accredited to work in many countries (e.g. USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, NZ, South Africa and others). By spending fewer years at university, you can start your veterinary career sooner and save on tuition fees.\nRenowned for an excellent lifestyle, New Zealand is a great place to study abroad for your American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) accredited veterinary degree.\nA note for Canadian and American applicants\nAn undergraduate veterinary degree is a different educational model than you would be used to. However, as our degree is accredited by the Canadian and American Veterinary Medical Associations, you can be confident that it is recognized as the equivalent of a DVM degree from a North American vet school. This means you can return and work in the same way as if you had graduated from a vet school there.", "url": "https://www.massey.ac.nz/study/all-qualifications-and-degrees/bachelor-of-veterinary-science-pre-selection-UBVSP/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "importantTag": ["science", "animal", "medical"]}, {"university_name": "Massey University", "acronym": "Massey", "world_ranking": 598, "address": "Massey University East Precinct Albany Expressway, SH17, Albany, Auckland 0632, New Zealand", "province": "Auckland", "country_code": "NZ", "geotag": ["east", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/uzPKZxGrk6cc3XjL7", "admission_email": "muc.admissions@massey.ac.nz", "phone_number": 64800627739, "website_url": "https://www.massey.ac.nz/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/university-calendar-and-regulations/english-language-competency/\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": {\"testName\": \"Academic IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.0 with no band less than 5.5\"}}}", "course_name": "Graduate Diploma in Information Sciences \u2013 GradDipInfSc", "faculty": "N/A", "program_length": "1 year\n          \n          full-time\n           (120 credits) \n        \nUp to 8 years part-time\nPart-time available", "education_level": "Diploma", "introduction": "The Graduate Diploma in Information Sciences (GradDipInfSc) is intended mainly for graduates in an unrelated area who are seeking to retrain or upskill in the information sciences. \u00a0Many of the students are studying via distance (online study) because they are working full time.\nMassey is one of the few universities in New Zealand where your information sciences qualification covers all five disciplines of computer science, data science, information technology, information systems and software engineering. \u00a0Many graduates have found it really useful to complete the Graduate Diploma \u201cwith no endorsement\u201d.\u00a0 This means that you can select the courses you are most interested in from across the range of subjects.\u00a0 You are strongly encouraged to select \u201cno endorsement\u201d.\nYou\u2019ll learn a broad spectrum of skills from business management through to software development. \u00a0So you\u2019ll emerge from your studies at Massey with a well-rounded understanding of the whole industry.

The first semester (starting in February) is referred to as the \u2018pre-selection\u2019 semester. Depending on your performance in the pre-selection semester courses and selection assessments, you may be selected to the \u2018professional phase\u2019 (4.5 years long) beginning in July. Selection is competitive so it pays to come well prepared for the pre-selection semester.\u00a0 Make sure you work on your communication and interpersonal skills and get a good background in the sciences before joining us.\nProfessional veterinary training\nIf you\u2019re selected into the professional phase, you\u2019ll be well trained in a broad range of animal species.

We understand it takes a special kind of person to choose to complete their veterinary degree abroad and we welcome you to join us.\nFast track your veterinary career\nIn New Zealand, professional training qualifications (like medicine, vet and law) are undergraduate degrees, so you don\u2019t need a previous degree to study. Whether you\u2019ve recently completed high school or have already done a couple of years or even a degree at university, you can join us to become a veterinarian in a total of five years or less.\nThe Massey veterinary degree is one of the fastest paths to becoming a fully qualified veterinarian, who is accredited to work in many countries (e.g. USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, NZ, South Africa and others). By spending fewer years at university, you can start your veterinary career sooner and save on tuition fees.\nRenowned for an excellent lifestyle, New Zealand is a great place to study abroad for your American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) accredited veterinary degree.\nA note for Canadian and American applicants\nAn undergraduate veterinary degree is a different educational model than you would be used to. However, as our degree is accredited by the Canadian and American Veterinary Medical Associations, you can be confident that it is recognized as the equivalent of a DVM degree from a North American vet school.
