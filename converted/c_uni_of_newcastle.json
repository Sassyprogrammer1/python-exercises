In the first three years students complete all the courses required for the Bachelor of Criminology degree, which includes eight core Law courses. In the final two years students study all remaining core and directed Law courses to complete the requirements of the accredited Bachelor of Laws (Honours) degree, which meets the academic requirements to practise law in NSW.\nAfter completing the Bachelor of Criminology, students are automatically enrolled into the Bachelor of Laws (Honours)/Diploma of Legal Practice Program in the fourth and fifth years of study. Students in the accredited Diploma of Legal Practice complete legal practice modules and practical legal training by working on real life cases at the University of Newcastle Legal Centre, and in external placements with law firms, legal professionals and in government departments and agencies.\nStudents who complete the combined Bachelor of Laws (Honours)/Diploma of Legal Practice program are eligible to seek admission to legal practice without any additional study or practical legal training or workplace experience. Students can opt not to complete the Diploma of Legal Practice, but will need to undertake their professional legal training through another approved provider if they want to be admitted to legal practice.\nOur combined Bachelor of Criminology/Bachelor of Laws (Honours) graduates can analyse and explain crime and criminality from multiple disciplinary perspectives, and use high level problem solving and communication skills to act as advocates in the criminal justice system. Having completed placements and work-integrated learning in diverse contexts, they are work ready and equipped to advocate for a range of stakeholders, and to address legal and social issues that shape the administration of justice in criminal law and related institutions.\nDomestic students who commence full time in Semester 2 should expect to complete the program in a minimum of 5.5 years.",

Pure science, applied to real world problems.\nAt the University of Newcastle we train engineers capable of solving the greatest global challenges. As a Chemical Engineer, you will apply the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, and also more specialised disciplines such as bio- and nanotechnology, to analyse and design processes, plants and control systems for productivity, safety and sustainability. You could work as a Process Engineer efficiently recovering iron ore from raw mine feed, on developing sustainable biofuel production for remote communities, or on removing heavy metals or other harmful substances from groundwater.\nWhat is chemical engineering?\nChemical Engineering is about designing efficient processes to produce, utilise, transport and transform materials and energy. Chemical engineers work in a vast range of industries, including both large-scale industries such as mineral processing and energy generation, down to the production of consumer products such as food and cosmetics.\nWhy combine engineering with mathematics? Complete these two bachelor degrees in just five years \u2013 deepen your technical skills with advanced maths courses.

These images can diagnose life-threatening diseases such as cancer and help monitor a patient\u2019s health.", "url": "https://www.newcastle.edu.au/degrees/bachelor-of-medical-radiation-science-honours-nuclear-medicine", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.newcastle.edu.au/study/international/how-to-apply\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"37,725\", \"tuitionText\": {\"span\": {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"AUD 37,725 (indicative annual fee, 2023)\", \"br\": \"\", \"small\": {\"#text\": \"Indicative annual fees are based on a full year full time load (80 units).\", \"a\": \"Find out more about fees\"}, \"input\": \"\"}}}, \"tuitionURL\": \"https://www.newcastle.edu.au/degrees/bachelor-of-medical-radiation-science-honours-nuclear-medicine\"}, \"applicationDeadline\": {\"deadline\": \"Semester\\u00a01\\u00a0(20\\u00a0Feb\\u00a02023),\"}, \"requirements\": {\"h4\": \"College of Health Medicine and Wellbeing\", \"div\": {\"h3\": \"Other things to consider\", \"p\": [\"Make sure you double check the special entry requirements, assumed knowledge or recommended studies for the degree:\", {\"#text\": \"You can look atfor options to brush up on knowledge before you start.\", \"a\": \"NUPrep\"}, {\"a\": {\"#text\": \"View University key dates\", \"span\": \"\"}}], \"div\": {\"div\": [{\"div\": [{\"a\": \"Admission Requirements\"}, {\"p\": [\"Admission to this program is available to Australian students, residents and international students.\", {\"#text\": \"During the admission process adjustment factors may be applied to your Selection Rank.\", \"a\": \"Find out if\\u00a0you are eligible.\"}, \"Apply for entry through UAC.
