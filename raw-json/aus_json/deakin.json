Build on the practical skills and depth of knowledge developed in the first three years of your degree by undertaking an advanced research project through Deakin's Bachelor of Film, Television and Animation (Honours). You will undergo an elevated study experience to emerge as a critically engaged, highly skilled screen practitioner and researcher. The honours program opens doors to a career in the screen industry or the opportunity to delve deeper into your research with a masters degree or PhD. By completing an additional year of specialised study, you will produce a significant screen production folio and gain that edge future employers are searching for in an industry renowned for its competitiveness.Do you want to further your skills in film, television and animation? You will be treated as an independent screen practitioner and your experience will be quite different from that you have experienced as an undergraduate student. Whether you are working as an individual practitioner or in a creative team, you will emerge from your honours year as a critically engaged and highly skilled screen practitioner and researcher. Take a deep dive into screen practice and build knowledge in traditional scholarly research. We teach you the fundamental skills of traditional scholarly research so that you can successfully locate your screen practice in the field and critically engage with the work of others. An honours year allows you the time to focus closely on your screen practice. The course has a deliberate focus to allow students to enter a single degree and receive highly regarded learning experiences in screen practice and research. After graduating, you can further your studies in research or professional practice by applying for direct entry into second year of the Master of Film and Television by coursework, a Master of Arts by Research, or you could pursue a PhD.",

Throughout this course you will gain a deep understanding of the philosophies, ethics and principles of health care research; knowledge of a range of research approaches; skills in data management, methods and tools for research practice; and skills in planning, implementing and reporting research studies. This course will give you an understanding of how to develop a research proposal, from the identification of a research issue and literature review through to writing and submitting the proposal for approval by an ethics committee. You will undertake a research project and an individual research thesis in the area of nursing practice and develop evaluation and research skills in nursing practice and health service delivery. You will be qualified for rewarding roles in all areas of nursing including acute care/sub-acute care, emergency, aged care, paediatrics and rehabilitation; in hospitals, government departments, district health services, the education sector, business and private industry. Alternatively, you may decide to undertake a research degree such as a research Masters or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).",

            "introduction": "Take the next step in your understanding of the effects of nutrition on our population with a Bachelor of Nutrition Science (Honours). You will complete coursework alongside an original research project, and develop a unique perspective of research occurring within Australia’s $20 billion dollar food industry.Are you ready to uncover research that could change society’s perception of food? Discover more about your area of interest within nutrition sciences by completing an honours year. You will not only build on your foundation knowledge of nutrition, but also enhance your skills to confidently conduct an original research project. Contribute to knowledge in your specialised area while gaining practical research experience among an ever-developing field. Paired with a supervisor who is an expert in their field, you will complete an original piece of research under their guidance. Along the way, you will gain an understanding of research methods and design, as well as experience in project planning and implementation. Examples of previous research projects include:  The political construction of obesity: a framing analysis of Australian parliamentary debates about junk-food advertising to children. The role of visual cues on flavour perception and liking of rice. Factors predictive of postoperative clinical outcomes in gastrointestinal surgical patients: A prospective observational study. Some of the research being conducted within our research centres such as the Food and Mood Centre and Global Obesity Centre includes the impact of food on mental health issues, such as depression, and the cost effectiveness of obesity prevention policies in Australia.  Deakin is home to leading Australian research centres CASS (Centre for Advanced Sensory Science) and IPAN (Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition), whose studies are at the forefront of food and nutrition research. You will also have the opportunity to study in our state-of-the-art food and nutrition facilities – including industry-standard food sensory labs – that will provide you with hands-on experience to put your research to the test. By completing your honours degree with Deakin’s School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, you will graduate with the relevant industry knowledge to pursue a career or complete further research and study. With over 150 partnerships spanning government and organisations within the health field, your learning will be relevant to industry. Graduate with the knowledge and skills required to confidently provide evidence-based advice regarding food and its impact on our health within community settings.",

Honours is a year of specialised study that allows you to combine the theory and practical skills gained throughout your undergraduate degree. While undertaking an individual creative project, you will be supported in your development as an independent practitioner as you build your skills, critical engagement and depth of knowledge in your chosen area of study. It is an opportunity to expand your knowledge in a field you are passionate about and to develop invaluable research and life skills that will stay with you throughout your career. Do you want to find your creative practice in the field and critically engage with the work of your contemporaries? With a strong interdisciplinary focus, this course enables students from all creative arts disciplines – dance, drama, photography, design, and visual arts – to learn from each other and develop their creative arts practice and scholarly research skills. You will form ongoing relationships with practitioners and peers in related creative areas through critical feedback with industry connections and research experts from government-run and community arts organisations. Whether you choose to work in industry as an individual practitioner, or within a creative team, this honours program will help you develop as a critically engaged thinker and highly skilled practitioner and researcher. After graduating, you can further your studies in research or professional practice by applying for direct entry into the second year of the Master of Creative Arts by coursework, a Master of Arts by Research, or you could pursue a PhD.",

            "introduction": "Through Deakin’s Bachelor of Zoology and Animal Science, you will explore the social and economic impact that human activity has on animals and their ecosystems. Investigate how animals respond and adapt to changes in the environment, including climate change, with a strong focus on Australian fauna and its unique importance in the global environment. Apply the latest research techniques to test hypotheses in the real-world and develop evidence-based decision-making skills valued by industry. You will work with living subjects in the lab and field, giving you a first-hand understanding of the form and function of animals and the underlying mechanisms that influence their ecology and evolution. You will also learn broadly about how animals respond to changing environments over time. Best of all, your journey will be supported by teaching staff who share your passion for animals. Interested in a career that cares for the future of our furry and feathered friends? If you’re fascinated by the way animals behave, adapt, evolve and survive, you’re not alone. Animal enthusiasts choose Deakin to turn their passion into a rewarding career because of our research-informed teaching and practical approach to learning. This hands-on approach ensures you will develop the technical and practical expertise required, as well as the communication, teamwork and critical-thinking skills to equip you for future roles in the field. As you advance through the course, you will be exposed to many unique aspects of zoology. These include physiological and behavioural adaptations to environmental change, disease ecology, animal sensory neurobiology and behaviour, as well as ecological and conservation genetics. The wide range of core units will broaden your skill set, expanding your career options across the growing zoology and animal science field. How you will learn is as important as what you will learn. Start preparing for your future career by undertaking a discipline-specific industry work placement. Study animals working alongside academic staff who aren’t just teachers, but researchers at the forefront of their respective fields.",

Deakin's Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Public Health and Health Promotion enables you to make a real difference in the health outcomes of individuals, communities and global populations.On top of the expertise required to qualify as a registered nurse, graduates can register with the International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE), with Deakin being the only Victorian university to hold this accreditation. The course balances contemporary theory with extensive placement experience, and combined approaches involving community engagement, policy development, and research. Graduate career-ready with 920 hours of work placements in both nursing and public health and health promotion settings.Passionate about helping people lead healthier lives, across clinical and community settings? This combined degree in nursing and public health and health promotion gives you the advantage of learning skills in two differing facets of health care. Public health is the organised response by society to protect and promote health and prevent disability. By looking at patterns of health and disease across populations, public health experts can use data and evidence-based measures to address the world’s biggest health challenges. Health promotion is about working with communities to improve health and champion factors that support good health – be they environmental, legal, physical, economic or social. You will study the foundations of modern health promotion practice, covering key study areas such as:   biostatistics  environmental health  epidemiology  health sociology  planning and evaluation.  While you will graduate with a suite of specialised and highly sought-after healthcare skills, you will also enter the workforce with lifelong transferable skills, in areas such as:    research  analytical thinking  project management  communication  community development.  Deakin’s purpose-built Clinical Simulation Centres for nursing students simulate real healthcare settings. They provide you with the facilities and equipment required to develop practical nursing skills, which are further enhanced through your clinical placements.  In your final year, you will also have the opportunity to complete the Public Health and Health Promotion Practicum unit, giving you 120 hours of invaluable practical experience in the health industry. ^2021 Employment Outlook – for the five years to November 2026, Australian Government National Skills Commission",
