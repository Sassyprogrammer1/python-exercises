Graduates with a degree in agriculture are highly sought after in Australia, with an employment rate of over 92 per cent.\nYou\u2019ll learn the science necessary to produce safe, high-quality and ethical food and fibre as well as the economics underpinning Australia\u2019s important role in international trade. Australia is a major global supplier of agricultural goods \u2013 around $40 billion of Australia\u2019s projected $60 billion of agricultural production in 2019\u201320 was exported.\nLEARN IN THE LAB AND THE FIELD\nAn agriculture degree lets you apply biology, chemistry, physics, and economics and see the real-world results of your actions. Whether you start your post-university career in a laboratory, on farms or in a bank, you\u2019ll be making a real impact on the world. You\u2019ll complement your lab and classroom learning with fieldwork, and you can even choose to spend a semester learning at our agricultural research and teaching campus at Dookie, giving you additional hands-on experience and knowledge of farm operations.\nAPPLY THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY\nAgriculture is at the beginning of a technological revolution, with research by Melbourne academics playing a leading role. Drone-based sensors can monitor plants for disease and water stress across areas equivalent to hundreds of football fields in under an hour. \u2018Big data\u2019 and machine learning will give you tools to help farmers grow more food while reducing agriculture\u2019s environmental impact. Study the science and economics underpinning these innovations and enter the workforce ready to contribute to sustainable and profitable agriculture.\nIMPROVE CROP AND ANIMAL HEALTH\nPlants and animals provide more food and fibre when we protect their health and welfare. Our academics determine the best ways to maintain the welfare of farm animals, develop diets to help livestock thrive in hot and dry conditions, discover the origin, spread and effects of disease and develop new medicines. Our scientists are using precision gene-editing tools to develop crops that can survive disease, drought and heat. Develop an understanding of plant and animal health and welfare to prepare you for a career in the agricultural industry or for further study in veterinary medicine.\nMAKE OUR FOOD SUPPLY SUSTAINABLE\nFarmers manage 48 per cent of Australia\u2019s landmass, and each year, on average, an Australian farmer will feed 600 people. But in a changing climate we need to maintain a healthy environment too. Benefit from the knowledge and expertise of our researchers as they find ways to make farming more drought-resilient, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and re-use waste while producing high-quality food. You\u2019ll learn how to monitor and optimise the transfer of nutrients from soils to plants to animals and how to make land and water use more sustainable by applying agricultural science and economics.\nPathway into the Bachelor of Agriculture\nStudents who complete the Diploma in General Studies pathway program will be eligible for substantial credit towards their Bachelor of Agriculture degree.", "url": "https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/undergraduate/bachelor-of-agriculture", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": "agricultural"}, {"university_name": "University of Melbourne", "acronym": "Melbourne", "world_ranking": 27, "address": "Parkville VIC 3010, Australia", "province": "VIC", "country_code": "AU", "geotag": ["east", "Melbourne"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/Ri499hmsddGue5MEA", "admission_email": "continuing-education@unimelb.edu.au", "phone_number": "+61 3 9035 5511", "website_url": "https://www.unimelb.edu.au/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://study.unimelb.edu.au/how-to-apply/english-language-requirements/undergraduate-english-language-requirements#navigation-languagetest\", \"type\": [{\"#text\": \"For all the undergraduate degrees, except the Bachelor of Oral Health\", \"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOEFL Internet-based test (including TOEFL iBT at Home)\", \"testMinScore\": \"79 and scores of 21 for writing, 18 for speaking, 13 for reading and 13 for listening\"}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 in the Academic International English Language Testing System (IELTS), with no bands less than 6.0\"}, {\"testName\": \"Pearson Test of English Academic (including PTE Academic Online)\", \"testMinScore\": \"58 and no PTE communicative skills score below 50\"}, {\"testName\": \"Cambridge English, Advanced/Certificate in Advanced English (CAE)\", \"testMinScore\": \"176 with no skill below 169.\"}, {\"testName\": \"C2 Proficiency (previously called Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE) examination)\", \"testMinScore\": \"180 with no skill below 180\"}]}, {\"#text\": \"For the Bachelor of Oral Health\", \"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOEFL Internet-based test (including TOEFL iBT at Home)\", \"testMinScore\": \"94 and scores of at least 27 for writing, 23 for speaking, 24 for reading and 24 for listening\"}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"7.0 in the Academic International English Language Testing System (IELTS), with no bands less than 7.0\"}, {\"testName\": \"Pearson Test of English Academic (including PTE Academic Online)\", \"testMinScore\": \"65 and achieve no PTE communicative skills score below 65\"}]}]}", "course_name": "Bachelor of Fine Arts (Screenwriting)", "faculty": "Fine Arts and Music", "program_length": "3 years full time", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "The Screenwriting specialisation is designed for those who have the desire and talent to write audience-driven stories for the screen.\nThe Bachelor of Fine Arts (Screenwriting) is the premier screenwriting undergraduate degree in Australia.

Urban planners and designers are actively engaged with some of the most pressing issues of our time, including increased urbanisation, climate change and sustainable resourcing.\nIn the Urban Planning major, you will develop a broad knowledge of the history, theory, leading concepts and principles of urban planning and design. You will understand the role of planners in influencing environmental sustainability, economic resilience and social equity in cities and towns, and be able to identify the main trends and factors shaping the development of local, national, regional and global communities.\nAs we adapt to global changes that impact our cities \u2013 including climate change, deepening social inequality, concerns for community health and safety, and the emergence of global city-regions \u2013 planning has never been more critical.", "url": "https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/major/urban-planning", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "environment"]}]
