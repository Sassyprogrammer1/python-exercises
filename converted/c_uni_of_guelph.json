Over 250 million people speak the language or live in francophone countries world-wide, including Africa and the Caribbean. The French language is everywhere\n\u00a0\nWhy French Matters\nThere are many reasons to consider a French degree, some of which include:\n1. Speaking French will increase your job prospects and potential salary\nMany governments, industries, and countries that trade with Canada speak French, which would allow for greater career mobility long-term.\n\n2. Understanding French will allow you to compete in the future global economy\nIn many countries, students learn 2-3 additional languages, which allows them to communicate easily and participate in business negotiations or transactions.\n\n3. Studying French increases your appreciation of other cultures and its people\nFrench is known as the gateway to art, music, dance, fashion, cuisine, architecture, sport, and cinema.\nFrom the Cannes International Film Festival to the Tour du France and the Louvre, the French language is present at some of the world\u2019s most renowned events and establishments, which you could be part of.\nAdditionally, as globalization and internationalization continue to rise across the world, cultural competency and international relationships become valuable assets.\n\n4. By learning a new language, you develop your creative and critical thinking skills\nUsing a different part of your brain to comprehend a new language, translate it, and communicate helps to improve memory, focus, creativity, and self-esteem.\n\n\u00a0\nFrench and Your Future Career\nAs a graduate of this program, you will have strong oral and written French language skills that you can apply successfully in teamwork, social awareness, critical thinking, research, management, and problem-solving within careers such as, teaching, immigration, entrepreneurship, marketing, translation services, government, international business, United Nations correspondence, and more.", "url": "https://www.uoguelph.ca/programs/french-studies", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["education", "teachers"]}, {"university_name": "University of Guelph", "acronym": "Guelph", "world_ranking": 497, "address": "50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/ic4AAFep7eEJGGjH7", "admission_email": "admission@uoguelph.ca", "phone_number": "+1 519-824-4120", "website_url": "https://www.uoguelph.ca/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://admission.uoguelph.ca/englprof\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"Advanced Level of the English Language Certificate Program (ELCP)\", \"testMinScore\": \"Successful completion of the University of Guelph\\u2019s Open Learning Advanced Level of the English Language Certificate Program (ELCP) (levels 9 and 10) is also considered an acceptable form of testing for English proficiency.\"}, {\"testName\": \"Cambridge English: C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency\", \"testMinScore\": \"176 with no band less than 169\"}, {\"testName\": \"Canadian Academic English (CAEL)\", \"testMinScore\": 70}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo English Test\", \"testMinScore\": 110}, {\"testName\": \"International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS -

To understand why society is the way it is, we need to understand the forces that influenced those decisions in history, if we wish to inform positive change for the future.\n\u00a0\nHistory's Influence on Today\nHistory also has relevance to today\u2019s society, especially in film, TV and video games, where some of the most highly rated and profitable shows of all time are based on historical events, people, eras, etc. Such as:\n\u2022 The Crown, The Tudors, Vikings, Bridgerton, 300: Sparta, Outlander, Game of Thrones, and The Last Dance (Michael Jordan).\n\u2022 Video games such as Assassin\u2019s Creed are similarly rooted in various historical eras and locations.\n\u00a0\nWhat You'll Learn\nUltimately, history is the backbone of all other subjects and ties you to the world around us, including the regions studied by our professors such as Canada, China, Scotland, Africa, India, Europe, and the Middle East. History allows you to pick any part of the world and go explore its past.\nIn this program, you will be able to connect your historical knowledge to other courses and subject areas like Sociology, Criminal Justice  Public Policy, Sexualities, Genders  Social Change, Black Canadian Studies, etc. This knowledge will prepare you for careers in education, law, business, entertainment, the public service, journalism, environmental preservation, and more.", "url": "https://www.uoguelph.ca/programs/history", "work_experience": "Co-op", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": "arts"}, {"university_name": "University of Guelph", "acronym": "Guelph", "world_ranking": 497, "address": "50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/ic4AAFep7eEJGGjH7", "admission_email": "admission@uoguelph.ca", "phone_number": "+1 519-824-4120", "website_url": "https://www.uoguelph.ca/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://admission.uoguelph.ca/englprof\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"Advanced Level of the English Language Certificate Program (ELCP)\", \"testMinScore\": \"Successful completion of the University of Guelph\\u2019s Open Learning Advanced Level of the English Language Certificate Program (ELCP) (levels 9 and 10) is also considered an acceptable form of testing for English proficiency.\"}, {\"testName\": \"Cambridge English: C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency\", \"testMinScore\": \"176 with no band less than 169\"}, {\"testName\": \"Canadian Academic English (CAEL)\", \"testMinScore\": 70}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo English Test\", \"testMinScore\": 110}, {\"testName\": \"International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS -

It drives your feelings, thoughts, and behaviours; psychologically (identity), sociologically (within culture), and physiologically (reproduction and attraction); but can lead to discrimination and harassment when outside the constructs of a heterosexual orientation.\n\u00a0\nGender Identity and Power\nGender identity has had a key role in defining power and privilege, often afforded to a specific gender binary, but at the core is how our social world is organized\u2014male or female, man or woman\u2014demanding people who live outside that gender structure (i.e., not cisgender) remain silent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYour Impact on the World\nWe are training future leaders, like you, to tackle complex problems from a variety of viewpoints, which will empower you to be flexible and practical.
