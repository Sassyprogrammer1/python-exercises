Occupational therapists work in collaboration with individuals or groups of individuals to prevent or address occupational performance difficulties. Occupational performance difficulties may arise from a health condition, developmental issue, environmental obstacle or a consequence of aging. Difficulties may occur in areas of self-care, productivity, or leisure. Occupational therapists enable their clients to reconstruct their life and develop a renewed sense of self-identity and independence.\nThe occupational therapy program follows the standards developed by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT). This allows students develop the skills and competencies needed to practice their profession upon graduation. In addition to the coursework, students complete 1,000 placement hours as required by CAOT. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools, community organizations,\u00a0the interprofessional university clinic and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nStudents complete this limited-enrollment program over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study (including placements). However, students with an undergraduate degree in occupational therapy at the time of admission can follow the accelerated program, which leads to a master\u2019s degree after one year (three terms). Students complete practical and theoretical courses, placements and on-site observation placements. Teaching activities are grouped under the following six themes:\n\nTheme 1: Occupational participation: interaction between the person, their occupations and their environment;\u00a0\nTheme 2: Fundamental principles for the practice as an occupational therapist (being a professional);\nTheme 3: Knowledge of health conditions and interventions - occupational therapist and the team;\u00a0\nTheme 4: Occupational therapy practice: assessment and intervention approaches to promote occupational participation;\u00a0\nTheme 5: Critical evaluation of knowledge;\u00a0\nTheme 6: Knowledge integration.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/honours-bachelor-health-sciences-population-and-public-health-option-master-health-sciences-occupational-therapy/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "law", "medical"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Bachelor of Music (BMus) - Musicology - Theory Profile", "faculty": "Arts", "program_length": "4 years", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "The School of Music at the University of Ottawa is one of the country's leading music schools.

Occupational therapists work in collaboration with individuals or groups of individuals to prevent or address occupational performance difficulties. Occupational performance difficulties may arise from a health condition, developmental issue, environmental obstacle or a consequence of aging. Difficulties may occur in areas of self-care, productivity, or leisure. Occupational therapists enable their clients to reconstruct their life and develop a renewed sense of self-identity and independence.\nThe occupational therapy program follows the standards developed by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT). This allows students develop the skills and competencies needed to practice their profession upon graduation. In addition to the coursework, students complete 1,000 placement hours as required by CAOT. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools, community organizations,\u00a0the interprofessional university clinic and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nStudents complete this limited-enrollment program over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study (including placements). However, students with an undergraduate degree in occupational therapy at the time of admission can follow the accelerated program, which leads to a master\u2019s degree after one year (three terms). Students complete practical and theoretical courses, placements and on-site observation placements.

The profession provides frontline client-centered healthcare services to help clients maintain and improve their functional independence; and prevent and manage pain, physical limitations, disabilities, and limits to participation in their activities (Canadian Physiotherapy Association, 2000). The goal of the physiotherapy program is to train bilingual physiotherapists who can serve francophone clients in Ontario and French-speaking communities across Canada and to foster excellence in research and teaching.\nThe program supports a client-centered approach and focuses on integrating evidence-based results from research on clinical decision-making. The conceptual framework of the program is based on the human movement sciences (kinesiology and pathokinesiology) and the clinical sciences and incorporates the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework as the standard for describing and measuring health and disability.\nThe MHSc in Physiotherapy program runs over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study. Students must complete 60 course units and 1,025 placement hours. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nThe program follows the national physiotherapy curriculum guidelines established by the Canadian Council of Physiotherapy University Programs. Upon completing their education, graduates who wish to register with the College of Physiotherapists of Ontario must successfully complete the Canadian physiotherapy competency examination (Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators).\nSince the mission of the physiotherapy program is to train bilingual professionals able to serve Francophone populations, the program is only offered in French. However, assignments and exams\u00a0can be written in either French or English. While French is the language of instruction, some clinical placements, however, take place in French, Bilingual and English settings.

Occupational therapists work in collaboration with individuals or groups of individuals to prevent or address occupational performance difficulties. Occupational performance difficulties may arise from a health condition, developmental issue, environmental obstacle or a consequence of aging. Difficulties may occur in areas of self-care, productivity, or leisure. Occupational therapists enable their clients to reconstruct their life and develop a renewed sense of self-identity and independence.\nThe occupational therapy program follows the standards developed by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT). This allows students develop the skills and competencies needed to practice their profession upon graduation. In addition to the coursework, students complete 1,000 placement hours as required by CAOT. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools, community organizations,\u00a0the interprofessional university clinic and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nStudents complete this limited-enrollment program over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study (including placements). However, students with an undergraduate degree in occupational therapy at the time of admission can follow the accelerated program, which leads to a master\u2019s degree after one year (three terms). Students complete practical and theoretical courses, placements and on-site observation placements. Teaching activities are grouped under the following six themes:\n\nTheme 1: Occupational participation: interaction between the person, their occupations and their environment;\u00a0\nTheme 2: Fundamental principles for the practice as an occupational therapist (being a professional);\nTheme 3: Knowledge of health conditions and interventions - occupational therapist and the team;\u00a0\nTheme 4: Occupational therapy practice: assessment and intervention approaches to promote occupational participation;\u00a0\nTheme 5: Critical evaluation of knowledge;\u00a0\nTheme 6: Knowledge integration.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/honours-bachelor-health-sciences-master-health-sciences-occupational-therapy/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "medical"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Honours Bachelor of Public Relations", "faculty": "Arts", "program_length": "4 years", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "The Department of Communication offers an Honours Bachelor in Public Relations.

The profession provides frontline client-centered healthcare services to help clients maintain and improve their functional independence; and prevent and manage pain, physical limitations, disabilities, and limits to participation in their activities (Canadian Physiotherapy Association, 2000). The goal of the physiotherapy program is to train bilingual physiotherapists who can serve francophone clients in Ontario and French-speaking communities across Canada and to foster excellence in research and teaching.\nThe program supports a client-centered approach and focuses on integrating evidence-based results from research on clinical decision-making. The conceptual framework of the program is based on the human movement sciences (kinesiology and pathokinesiology) and the clinical sciences and incorporates the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework as the standard for describing and measuring health and disability.\nThe MHSc in Physiotherapy program runs over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study. Students must complete 60 course units and 1,025 placement hours. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nThe program follows the national physiotherapy curriculum guidelines established by the Canadian Council of Physiotherapy University Programs. Upon completing their education, graduates who wish to register with the College of Physiotherapists of Ontario must successfully complete the Canadian physiotherapy competency examination (Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators).\nSince the mission of the physiotherapy program is to train bilingual professionals able to serve Francophone populations, the program is only offered in French.

Occupational therapists work in collaboration with individuals or groups of individuals to prevent or address occupational performance difficulties. Occupational performance difficulties may arise from a health condition, developmental issue, environmental obstacle or a consequence of aging. Difficulties may occur in areas of self-care, productivity, or leisure. Occupational therapists enable their clients to reconstruct their life and develop a renewed sense of self-identity and independence.\nThe occupational therapy program follows the standards developed by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT). This allows students develop the skills and competencies needed to practice their profession upon graduation. In addition to the coursework, students complete 1,000 placement hours as required by CAOT. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools, community organizations,\u00a0the interprofessional university clinic and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nStudents complete this limited-enrollment program over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study (including placements). However, students with an undergraduate degree in occupational therapy at the time of admission can follow the accelerated program, which leads to a master\u2019s degree after one year (three terms). Students complete practical and theoretical courses, placements and on-site observation placements.

It provides the knowledge, skills and techniques required for you to play a leading role in developing and implementing evidence-based approaches that maintain and improve human movement, and lead to positive health outcomes for different populations in a variety of settings. While the program focuses on disciplines such as anatomy, biomechanics, exercise physiology, motor control and psychomotor behaviour, it also provides an understanding of how the social sciences contribute to human movement and performance. Students have the opportunity to do experiential education internships in a community venue, or do a research project supervised by faculty. This degree can lead to admission to graduate studies in human kinetics and advanced degrees in allied health and rehabilitation sciences such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, medicine, or chiropractic studies. Potential additional certifications: College of Kinesiologists of Ontario (Registered Kinesiologist), Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (Certified Personal Trainer, Certified Exercise Physiologist).\n\n\nMaster of Health Sciences Physiotherapy\nThis program is offered in French.\nPhysiotherapy is a self-governing profession that promotes fitness, health and wellness. The profession provides frontline client-centered healthcare services to help clients maintain and improve their functional independence; and prevent and manage pain, physical limitations, disabilities, and limits to participation in their activities (Canadian Physiotherapy Association, 2000). The goal of the physiotherapy program is to train bilingual physiotherapists who can serve francophone clients in Ontario and French-speaking communities across Canada and to foster excellence in research and teaching.\nThe program supports a client-centered approach and focuses on integrating evidence-based results from research on clinical decision-making. The conceptual framework of the program is based on the human movement sciences (kinesiology and pathokinesiology) and the clinical sciences and incorporates the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework as the standard for describing and measuring health and disability.\nThe MHSc in Physiotherapy program runs over six consecutive terms, i.e., two years of full-time study. Students must complete 60 course units and 1,025 placement hours. These mandatory placements can take place in Ottawa-area hospitals, schools and rehabilitation centres or at locations outside the National Capital Region.\nThe program follows the national physiotherapy curriculum guidelines established by the Canadian Council of Physiotherapy University Programs. Upon completing their education, graduates who wish to register with the College of Physiotherapists of Ontario must successfully complete the Canadian physiotherapy competency examination (Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators).\nSince the mission of the physiotherapy program is to train bilingual professionals able to serve Francophone populations, the program is only offered in French. However, assignments and exams\u00a0can be written in either French or English. While French is the language of instruction, some clinical placements, however, take place in French, Bilingual and English settings. Students must therefore have a working knowledge of English.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/honours-bachelor-science-human-kinetics-master-health-sciences-physiotherapy/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "arts", "education", "business", "HR", "medical"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Honours BSc Biology (Research Focus) - Ecology, Evolution, Behaviour Option", "faculty": "Science", "program_length": "4 years", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "Recent discoveries and new technologies are revolutionizing the biological sciences, placing increasing emphasis on integrating knowledge across all levels of organization, from molecules to ecosystems.\u00a0 Our programs give students both the intellectual tools and the hands-on experience they need to pursue careers in fields as diverse as conservation and endangered species; land-use management; ecotoxicology; academic, industry or government research; or health care.\u00a0 Learning takes place through traditional classroom instruction, innovative laboratory projects with state-of-the-art technologies, field-based courses around the world, and a strong research program in which undergraduate students of all years are intensively mentored in a research lab.\n\u00a0The honours program in biology allows for in-depth study in one or more biological disciplines.

Students will be offered courses oriented towards the core competencies required by the College of Kinesiologists of Ontario to pursue a professional career as a Registered Kinesiologist (R Kin). Students will gain theoretical and practical training, and will acquire skills to critically examine literature in the biophysical sciences of human movement.\nStudents will acquire knowledge, competencies and techniques for assessing and promoting performance and functional capacity, and for preventing and managing injury and chronic disease. They will obtain practical skills in exercise prescription to enhance performance and health, and for the treatment of individuals with compromised function. Students will have opportunities to gain training in how to use exercise in the management of injury, chronic disease, and in rehabilitation. They will have opportunities to gain training in ergonomics to critically assess and design equipment and workplaces to optimize performance and minimize musculoskeletal injury risk. They will gain applied counselling skills in principles of behaviour change to help individuals become more physically active and to help them enhance their health and well-being. Students will acquire knowledge in class settings and in laboratory-based and field practicum. In these rich practical experiences, they will learn to interact with different populations, from either different age groups (preschoolers, youth, young adults, the aged) or from groups of varying functional levels (e.g., athletes, sedentary people, persons with chronic disease, people in rehabilitation). Our students will gain practical experiences that better prepare them to pursue a career as a kinesiologist.\nOur graduates are eligible to challenge the professional licensing examination for the College of Kinesiologists of Ontario, the external regulatory body for the profession of kinesiology and the R Kin designation. Applied Studies in Kinesiology enable graduates to pursue various career-paths in different occupational roles. For example, our graduates can become strength and conditioning coaches in high-performance training facilities and professional sport organizations. They can work among allied health professionals in community health centres and outpatient hospital programs, prescribing exercise treatments to help people manage chronic conditions. Our graduates can also find roles in rehabilitation clinics prescribing exercise and mobility protocol to facilitate injured persons\u2019 return to work.

You will have the opportunity to be exposed to the latest developments in the field of communication (communication strategies, digital media, evolution of the media industry, advertising, crisis communications, negotiations, etc.). The Department of Communication offers courses in two main areas: media studies and organizational communication (internal and external communication in public and private organizations, health communication, organizational change, etc.). Combining theory and practice, our programs develop your critical and analytical skills and prepare you either for a professional career or for advanced studies.\nSociology\nSociology involves the study of societies, specifically their institutions, cultures, and transformations. Sociologists seek to uncover the processes, rules, and norms that govern social relations. They seek to understand issues such as the origins and consequences of social inequalities and collective behaviours. In our programs, students have the opportunity to apply theoretical approaches to real-world cases and learn how to use research tools such as interviewing, discourse analysis, surveys, and statistical analyses. The connection between theory and research enables students to understand a range of contemporary social issues, such as poverty, ethnic relations, deviance, gender relations, international development, power, and technology.\n\n\nThis program is offered in English and in French.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/joint-honours-ba-communication-sociology/", "work_experience": "Co-op", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "education", "environment", "business", "HR"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Honours BSocSc International Studies and Modern Languages", "faculty": "Social Sciences", "program_length": "4 years", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "This multi-disciplinary program introduces students to the study of international issues, trans-border phenomena and intercultural relations of all kinds.

It examines public management principles from various perspectives (administration, financial management, human resources, ethics, administrative reforms, governance, etc.) and the processes involved in designing public policies (policy cycle, roles of various stakeholders, ideologies, contextual factors, etc.). The program offers a high-quality education to students seeking a career in the public or para-public sectors, as well as those who seek to work in the private or non-profit sectors, or in government relations.\nPolitical Science\nPolitics is omnipresent in our lives. Political science seeks to describe, analyze, understand and assess the principles and power relations that govern social life. It revolves as much around the structures and institutions that define these relations and principles as around the ideas and practices that drive them. It studies everything that influences political life and institutions (ideologies, groups, social movements, etc.) on a local, regional, national and international scale.\nOur programs offer in-depth training in political science and encourage critical reflection on pivotal issues like citizenship, identity, political participation, globalization and development, governance and the state, and ethics and democracy. A discipline open to many theoretical and methodological approaches, political science constantly exchanges and shares with other fields.

The rigorous training our students receive in analyzing and understanding complex problems is valuable in many future careers. While many of our graduates have established careers in universities and in the high tech sector as research and development scientists, others have used their physics degrees as a springboard to careers in finance, administration, medicine, management or education. The range of career opportunities is perhaps wider than for any other students with a science education.\u00a0\nPhysicists have revolutionized the way we live our lives, with groundbreaking discoveries and new technologies, transferable to other fields such as biology or finance. Our professors and graduates are an important part of this chain. Many of our professors have also been recognized for their teaching and are seen as world-class researchers in their fields of expertise.\u00a0\nThe research conducted by the professors in the Department of Physics is concentrated in several sub-specialties, including the physics of biological and complex systems, condensed matter physics, photonics and the physics of geomaterials. Depending upon your choice of program, you have the opportunity to take courses and participate in research projects in these specialized areas.\u00a0\nIn addition to the Honours BSc in Physics, we offer three other Honours BSc programs. The first is in physics-mathematics, which provides enriched mathematics training within a physics program. The second is the option in photonics, which gives students a solid training in physics and a more applied and industry-related training in photonics. The third is the option in biological physics, which teaches students to apply a rigorous education in physics to various areas of life sciences. We also offer a Major in Physics that can form the core of an Honours BSc when combined with a major or a minor in another discipline in the Faculty of Science, or in another faculty. Finally, starting in fall 2016, we will offer a five-year integrated program in physics (BSc) and electrical engineering (BASc), jointly with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS). This unique program will offer a full education in physics and electrical engineering. Graduates will be sought after by industry and academia, as they will have the capacity to develop technology from a basic physics idea to the final product.\u00a0\nThe Department of Physics also has strong graduate programs, leading to an MSc or PhD.

We are a full-service music school offering programs in performance, composition, music education, piano pedagogy, theory and musicology.\u00a0\nAlthough any of our programs can pave the way for a career in education, musicology, music journalism or arts administration, the Bachelor of Music (BMus) is designed specifically for students wishing to become career musicians. Admission to the BMus therefore requires that you audition on your main instrument and demonstrate an intermediate or advanced level. In addition, the University of Ottawa is one of the only institutions in the country to offer the possibility of combining the BMus program in performance with a major in science.\nThis program is offered in English and in French.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/major-music-studies/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["arts", "education", "teachers"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Major in Political Science", "faculty": "Social Sciences", "program_length": "1 year", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "Politics is omnipresent in our lives.

It shares many of the theoretical perspectives, social and animal justice goals, and pedagogical tools of other advocacy-oriented disciplines.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/microprogram-animal-studies/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["agricultural", "animal", "education", "teachers", "medical"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Microprogram Arts Administration", "faculty": "N/A", "program_length": "0 years", "education_level": "Diploma", "introduction": "", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/microprogram-arts-administration/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["agricultural", "arts"]}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Microprogram Geomatics", "faculty": "Arts", "program_length": "N/A", "education_level": "Diploma", "introduction": "The field of geomatics uses science and information technologies to gather and manage spatial data.

The first is in physics-mathematics, which provides enriched mathematics training within a physics program. The second is the option in photonics, which gives students a solid training in physics and a more applied and industry-related training in photonics. The third is the option in biological physics, which teaches students to apply a rigorous education in physics to various areas of life sciences. We also offer a Major in Physics that can form the core of an Honours BSc when combined with a major or a minor in another discipline in the Faculty of Science, or in another faculty. Finally, starting in fall 2016, we will offer a five-year integrated program in physics (BSc) and electrical engineering (BASc), jointly with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS). This unique program will offer a full education in physics and electrical engineering. Graduates will be sought after by industry and academia, as they will have the capacity to develop technology from a basic physics idea to the final product.\u00a0\nThe Department of Physics also has strong graduate programs, leading to an MSc or PhD.

How can we understand and explain what we observe around us, from the smallest sub-atomic particles to the largest galaxies? How can we apply this understanding to manipulate our world? Studying physics gives insight into the fundamental laws of nature.\u00a0\nBut an education in physics gives so much more. The rigorous training our students receive in analyzing and understanding complex problems is valuable in many future careers. While many of our graduates have established careers in universities and in the high tech sector as research and development scientists, others have used their physics degrees as a springboard to careers in finance, administration, medicine, management or education. The range of career opportunities is perhaps wider than for any other students with a science education.\u00a0\nPhysicists have revolutionized the way we live our lives, with groundbreaking discoveries and new technologies, transferable to other fields such as biology or finance. Our professors and graduates are an important part of this chain. Many of our professors have also been recognized for their teaching and are seen as world-class researchers in their fields of expertise.\u00a0\nThe research conducted by the professors in the Department of Physics is concentrated in several sub-specialties, including the physics of biological and complex systems, condensed matter physics, photonics and the physics of geomaterials. Depending upon your choice of program, you have the opportunity to take courses and participate in research projects in these specialized areas.\u00a0\nIn addition to the Honours BSc in Physics, we offer three other Honours BSc programs. The first is in physics-mathematics, which provides enriched mathematics training within a physics program. The second is the option in photonics, which gives students a solid training in physics and a more applied and industry-related training in photonics. The third is the option in biological physics, which teaches students to apply a rigorous education in physics to various areas of life sciences. We also offer a Major in Physics that can form the core of an Honours BSc when combined with a major or a minor in another discipline in the Faculty of Science, or in another faculty. Finally, starting in fall 2016, we will offer a five-year integrated program in physics (BSc) and electrical engineering (BASc), jointly with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS). This unique program will offer a full education in physics and electrical engineering. Graduates will be sought after by industry and academia, as they will have the capacity to develop technology from a basic physics idea to the final product.\u00a0\nThe Department of Physics also has strong graduate programs, leading to an MSc or PhD. They give students the opportunity to work on cutting edge science in a research group led by one or more department professors.\n\n\nThis program is offered in English and in French.", "url": "https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/minor-physics/", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": "science"}, {"university_name": "University Of Ottawa", "acronym": "Ottawa", "world_ranking": 215, "address": "75 Laurier Ave. E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada", "province": "ON", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["central", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/J9Bf4N59ZfXZg57k7", "admission_email": "admissions@uOttawa.ca", "phone_number": "+1 613-562-5700", "website_url": "https://www2.uottawa.ca/en", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/universities/ottawa/language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"TOELF\", \"testMinScore\": [\"iBT Internet-based: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Home edition: 86 overall, with 22 in Writing\", \"Essentials: 8.5 overall, with 8 in Writing, 8 in Listening and 8 in Speaking\", \"Paper delivered: 22 in Writing, 20 in Listening and Reading\"]}, {\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 (overall score) with 6.5 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE\", \"testMinScore\": \"60 (overall score) with 60 in Writing\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"20 (overall score), with 120 in literacy\"}]}}", "course_name": "Minor in Religious Studies", "faculty": "Arts", "program_length": "1 year", "education_level": "Diploma", "introduction": "The Minor in Religious Studies is an ideal way to pursue an interest in religion while focusing on a Major or Honours in another program.
