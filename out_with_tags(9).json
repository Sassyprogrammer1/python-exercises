Geomatics is a field that collects geospatial data about the world around us and uses tools like land surveying, remote sensing, GIS systems, geography and computer science to help digitize the world. This knowledge and data can then be used to decide where buildings, roads and houses are built, power the technology of self-driving vehicles, assist in emergency and disaster management and much more. Blend your knowledge of science and engineering with information technologies to solve complex, real-world issues such as tracking a vehicle\u2019s location within a city or determining land use from a satellite image. Focus on the science and technologies related to positioning and navigation, sensors, measurements and mapping, as well as on spatial awareness and intelligence.",
