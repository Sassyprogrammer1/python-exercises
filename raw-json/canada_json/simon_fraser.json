Do you know that spatial data can be used to help address inequities in health care access, pollution exposure, and more?\nPursuing a Bachelor of Science in GIS will allow you to display and analyze spatial data using geographic information system technologies. You will learn to create and interpret data in the form of maps, figures and models. GIScience combines computer cartography, remote sensing, spatial data analysis, spatial theory and geovisualization.",

Do you want to know why our climate is changing and what our future climate will look like? Did you know that soil resources for food production are threatened?\nA Bachelor of Science in Physical Geography will have you exploring earth systems science by studying the interactions between air (atmosphere), water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere) and the spaces where organisms live (biosphere). You will investigate the events that influence our lives and how we are altering the Earth’s environmental systems.  You will tailor your studies to match your interests and career goals. You will be eligible for professional certification in the environmental and resource sectors.",
