You will build business acumen while working in an environment where creative ideas and methods cross-pollinate. As you gain technical competency, you will collaborate and innovate with peers, faculty and visitors, building personal communication and networking skills. Intensive lectures and labs provide direction and practical experience, sharpening technical skills and stimulating critical discourse, using student work as a starting point. Access to equipment and computing spaces enables reflective and collaborative project work. Historical, legal, ethical and theoretical considerations are built into the creative process.\nAs part of the program, you will take courses that deepen your awareness of your roles as a citizen conscious of the social, political, environmental and cultural contexts of your work. As a senior student in this program, you will specialize in advanced communication theory and techniques.

Through this hands-on learning process, students will develop the fundamental creative and technical multimedia design and development capabilities needed to pursue a career in user experience (UX) design, user interface (UI) design, product design, videography, motion graphics, and front-end development.\u00a0\nMultimedia Design and Development is one of two programs within Humber\u2019s interaction and design common platform cluster. The first semester of this program is shared with the three-year Graphic Design program. This offers students exposure to the different areas of programming, common elements of design and creative thinking, and collaborative work with students studying to work in complementary career fields. Greater exposure to the ever-evolving exciting world of design and development will allow students to investigate the edges of this area of study, and then students will confirm their focus prior to the second semester of study.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnder the guidance of experienced and knowledgeable professors, students learn on and become experienced with industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, XD, Audition and Premiere. Web technologies such as HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS and MongoDB are employed in hands-on learning situations in our applied teaching environment with relevant industry projects.\u00a0\nStudents cultivate important collaborative teamwork and project management skills through group assignments both within this program and through interdisciplinary work with students in sister programs. This prepares students for collaborative projects in the field and helps students gain a real-world perspective on the nature of multimedia work. Students prepare to pursue new media opportunities by developing a comprehensive portfolio that they can present to potential employers or clients, and they are exposed to entrepreneurial opportunities open to professionals in this rich field.
