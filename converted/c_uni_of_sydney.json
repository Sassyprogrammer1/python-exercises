From writing and presenting to thinking ethically and critically, the BLAS degree is your preparation for life beyond the classroom.\nThis is a course designed for the student who is fascinated by the world and wants to learn as much about it as they can. With a BLAS degree, you can indulge your interests in both the arts and sciences without restricting yourself to just one specialist area of study.\nOver the three-year degree, you choose either an arts or a science major. With over 40 arts majors and 30 science majors, that adds up to almost 80 choices, from Philosophy to Physics to Political Economy. You will then complement your major by choosing subjects from the other area, ensuring you leave with the well-rounded knowledge base that defines graduates of liberal arts degrees.\nBut the BLAS degree is about much more than what facts and figures you learn. It's about getting skills that can be used in life beyond the classroom. A special Liberal Studies stream has been built into the BLAS degree to boost your communication and analytical skills, which potential employers have told us time and time again are the skills that they look for in recruits.\nYou have the choice to complete with a major from Science or Arts.\nExamples of popular Science majors offered by our academic schools are listed below:\u00a0\n\n\nChemistry\u00a0(including Nanoscience and Nanotechnology)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nComputer Science\u00a0(including\u00a0Computer Science\u00a0and\u00a0Software Development)\nGeosciences\u00a0(including\u00a0Geography and Geology and Geophysics)\nHistory and Philosophy of Science\nLife and Environmental Science\u00a0(including\u00a0Animal Science,\u00a0Biology, Ecology,\u00a0Environment\u00a0and\u00a0Food Science)\nMathematics and Statistics\u00a0(including\u00a0Data Science)\nPhysics\u00a0(including Nanoscience and Nanotechnology)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nPsychology\nVeterinary Science\n\nFaculty of Arts and Social Sciences majors include:\n\nAgricultural and Resource Economics\nHistory\nAmerican Studies\nIndigenous Studies\nAncient Greek\nIndonesian Studies\nAncient History\nInternational Relations\nAnthropology\nInternational and Comparative Literary Studies\nArabic Language and Cultures\nItalian Studies\nArchaeology\nItalian Studies (Advanced)\nArt History\nItalian Studies (Intermediate)\nAsian Studies\nItalian Studies (Introductory)\nBiblical Studies and Classical Hebrew\nJapanese Studies\nChinese Studies\nJewish Civilisation, Thought and Culture\nCriminology\nKorean Studies\nCultural Studies\nLatin\nDigital Cultures\nLinguistics\nEconometrics\nModern Greek Studies\nEconomic Policy\nMusic\nEconomics\nPhilosophy\nEnglish\nPolitical Economy\nEuropean Studies\nPolitics\nFilm Studies\nSocio-Legal Studies\nFinancial Economics\nSociology\nFrench and Francophone Studies\nSpanish and Latin American Studies\nGender Studies\nStudies in Religion\u00a0\nGermanic Studies\nTheatre and Performance Studies\nHebrew (Modern)", "url": "https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-liberal-arts-and-science0.html", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "arts"]}, {"university_name": "The University of Sydney", "acronym": "Sydney", "world_ranking": 28, "address": "Camperdown NSW 2006, Australia", "province": "NSW", "country_code": "AU", "geotag": ["east", "Sydney"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/FVyynK68iF9zHCAL7", "admission_email": "", "phone_number": "+61 2 9351 2222", "website_url": "https://www.sydney.edu.au/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.sydney.edu.au/study/how-to-apply/international-students/english-language-requirements.html\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.5 with no band below 6.0\"}, {\"testName\": \"TOEFL iBT\", \"testMinScore\": 85}, {\"testName\": \"PTE Academic\", \"testMinScore\": 61}, {\"testName\": \"Cambridge English Scale: CAE and CPE\", \"testMinScore\": 176}]}}", "course_name": "Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Advanced Studies", "faculty": "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences", "program_length": "4 years full-time", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "In response to COVID-19, the University of Sydney has reviewed the availability of courses to be delivered remotely for students commencing their studies in 2021 and 2022.\nStudents commencing some subject areas in this course in 2021 and 2022 are required to commence their studies in-person on campus.
