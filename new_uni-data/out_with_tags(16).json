Biomedical engineering is much more than applying engineering methods to living organisms. As a graduate, you will have the confidence and ability to communicate with different players in the life science fields, from clinicians and nurses to designers, scientists and other engineers. You will be able to see present needs and identify future solutions. Engineering solutions for health is one of the research priorities at the University of Calgary, with interdisciplinary research involving more than 300 faculty from the engineering school and non-traditional biomedical fields like nursing, veterinary medicine and kinesiology. There is a growing biomedical industry in Alberta and in Canada that needs graduates with skills that range from problem solving to teamwork and interpersonal communication.\nThe Biomedical Engineering program has a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. A design backbone throughout the Biomedical Engineering program will form critical thinking and problem solving skills and provide opportunities to interact with local industry and researchers in many different fields of study. Most courses have hands-on, experiential laboratory sessions to reinforce concepts taught in lectures. Leadership skills development is fostered through open-ended projects and group work.\nCareer opportunities\nAs a biomedical engineer you will be able to use your skills to improve healthcare worldwide in the biotech, pharma and med-tech sectors \u2014 and beyond. A degree in biomedical engineering can also open doors for graduate studies or a professional degree such as medicine, veterinary medicine or law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nCollaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.\nEngineering Career Centre \u2013 Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid engineering work experience through a 12-16 month placement.\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nCourses in this program\nComputing for Engineers, Calculus for Engineers and Scientists, Biology for Engineers,\u00a0Introduction to Biomedical Engineering,\u00a0Anatomy and Physiology for Engineers,\u00a0Biomedical Engineering Processes, Mechanics,\u00a0Biomedical Signals, Systems \u00a0Instrumentation,\u00a0Fundamentals of Biomedical Devices and\u00a0Technologies,\u00a0Sensor Systems and Data Analytics in Biomedical\u00a0Engineering,\u00a0Transport Phenomena in Biomolecular Systems, \u00a0Biomedical Engineering Design\nDetailed course information\nResources for First-Year StudentsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

Can industrial processes be redesigned to reduce pollution? How can we ensure safe chemical plant operations?\nChemical engineers convert raw materials into valuable products, or separate complex mixtures into their constituent components. Chemical engineering is one of the most broadly-based engineering disciplines, which means the techniques and skills you\u2019ll gain will be directly applicable to a wide range of real world work environments. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials, and through designing a complete industrial process for a specific product.\u00a0\nThis fully accredited program features a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. These courses will provide you with a solid foundation for your engineering training and introduce you to a variety of engineering disciplines.\u00a0You'll apply for admission to a specific engineering program at the end of your first year.\u00a0\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bChemical engineers enjoy stable career prospects because the items they manufacture are in constant demand. You\u2019ll have global opportunities to work in areas such as biomedicine, scientific research, biotechnology, and more. A degree in engineering can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nCollaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.\nEngineering Career Centre \u2013 Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid engineering work experience through a 12-16 month placement.\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nCourses in this program\nChemical Engineering Process Calculation, Computing for Engineers, Engineering Design and Communication, General Chemistry for Engineers, \u200bCalculus for Engineers and Scientists\nDetailed course information\nResources for First-Year StudentsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

Choreographers craft human movement in myriad ways to create meaning and make commentary on the world around us.\nBy studying how to create, perform and analyze dance, you will learn to ask such questions as: What frames our experience of dance? What kind of meaning exists in specific movements, at different times and in different places? What political and historical events have shaped specific dance forms? How do our choreographic choices impact an audience? How can we study dances and dancers from different angles \u2013 culturally, emotionally, psychologically, intellectually and scientifically? How does kinesthetic awareness shape the dancing experience? How can we improve dance technique to prevent injury? How can we represent dance through digital technologies and what do such technologies offer our analysis of dance and the dancing body?\nDance enables you to fully experience yourself and your place in the world by heightening your senses, sharpening your perceptions, honing your physical capacity, and drawing attention to issues of representation and identity. In this program, you will transform your knowledge of dance by engaging with dance history, pedagogy, choreography, dance science, critical theory, dance for the camera, improvisation, dance production, and various dance techniques. During the course of your studies you will gain creative thinking skills, research and analytical capabilities, written and verbal communication skills, as well as a rigorous practical and theoretical training in dance.\nIn the UCalgary Dance program, you can earn either a Bachelor of Fine Arts, a Bachelor of Arts in Dance, or you can enroll in one of our combined degrees, earning a joint Bachelor of Arts in Dance/Bachelor of Kinesiology or a Bachelor of Arts in Dance/Bachelor of Education in just five years.\nCareer opportunities\nAs a Dance graduate, you will be prepared for career opportunities in such areas as dance performance, choreography, dance teaching, dance administration, dance journalism, dance scholarship, dance and digital technology, and/or dance science. An Arts degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or other professional degrees in such areas as medicine, education, law, architecture, journalism, arts administration, business, filmmaking, social work, or environmental design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nTake workshops and classes from nationally and internationally renowned guest artists.\nCourses in this program\nSample courses in this program include Creative Process, Contemporary Technique, Dance Pedagogy, Dance History, Safe Dance Practice, Dance for the Camera, Cross Cultural Currents: Dance Theory and Global Forms, Dance Anatomy, Performance Practicum, Jazz, Ballet, Hip Hop and more\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ArtsFirst year Degree Guide - Fine ArtsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

Economists ask questions such as what gets produced, how is it produced, and who gets what is produced.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bAs an Economics student, you'll study the logic of human choice under conditions of scarcity, and examine the social institutions that determine how scarce resources are used.

And in the process of studying it, you\u2019ll learn to read critically, write persuasively, ask powerful questions, and even develop your own craft as a creative writer. We study classic authors like William Shakespeare and Emily Bront\u00eb but also Indigenous literatures, literature in English from all over the world, experimental poetry, and even popular media such as video games and comics. We specialize in ideas that have changed the world and are continuing to change it.\nIn English, you will study the history of literatures in English, but also literatures from local communities, a wide range of international literatures in English, and writing by all sorts of brilliant, daring people, including Black and Indigenous authors and other writers of colour. And you can develop your own skills as a creative writer, too.\nCareer opportunities\nData consistently show that English graduates go on to a wide and impressive range of careers\u2014not only as teachers and writers, but also in business, government, arts, technology, and non-profit sectors. The skills that employers seek most are communication, writing, analysis, and problem-solving\u2014skills that an English major particularly learns. Also, our students frequently go on to graduate and professional schools, not only in literary studies or creative writing, but also in law, business, library sciences, medicine, veterinary medicine, and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nHonours Degree - In-depth study of a specific topic completed under the supervision of a faculty member.\nCo-operative work placement - Gain valuable full-time paid work experience that alternates with your academic studies.\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nCourses in this program\nIntroduction to Contemporary Theoretical Practices, Literature in English from the Middle Ages to the Present, Shakespeare, Women's Literary Tradition, \u200bLiterary Analysis\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ArtsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

How and when did the Rocky Mountains form? Where can we find useful resources such as water, hydrocarbons, and metals?\nThe entire world will be your laboratory, as geology is the most outdoor-oriented scientific discipline. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials and in laboratories. You may also gain hands-on experience conducting research at field schools in both Canada and the United States.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bGeologists have global career opportunities in resource industries (oil and gas and other energy resources, metals and other natural materials), engineering/environmental assessment firms, state geological surveys, research institutions, and more.

It requires empathy for historical actors, respect for interpretive debate, and the skillful use of an evolving set of practices and tools.\nHistory is about change and continuity over time and space. Historians gain an understanding of complex cause-and-effect relationships by gathering, organizing and evaluating historical sources from a variety of perspectives. During the course of your studies, you'll gain research capabilities, develop your oral and verbal communication, logical and abstract reasoning skills, and the capacity to think in historical terms.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bAs a history graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the non-profit sector, the private sector and the business world. A degree in history can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, business, journalism, government service, or education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nArts and Science Honours Academy (ASHA) - A six-course interdisciplinary program with a second language aspect and travel components.\nCo-operative work placement - Gain valuable full-time paid work experience that alternates with your academic studies.\nHonours Degree - In-depth study of a specific topic completed under the supervision of a faculty member.\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nCourses in this program\nCanada: Origins to 1867, Events and Ideas that Shook the World, History of Europe, The World to 1500, \u200bThe Practice of History\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ArtsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

What physiological changes characterize the relaxation response? How do humans adapt to environmental stresses?\nKinesiology involves the multidisciplinary study of human movement and function. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class and during labs. Enrolling in the Kinesiology program will allow you to develop a solid kinesiology foundation from which you can build a specialized degree that allows you to explore your interests and career goals.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bKinesiologists have global opportunities to work in areas such as coaching, recreation, health and fitness, research, and more. A degree in Kinesiology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nLab work - Learn how to use tools and develop techniques within a supervised laboratory setting.\nPracticum experience - Opportunity to gain hands-on career related experiences in a professional setting.\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nCourses in this program\nActivity (Essence and Experience), Introduction to Motor Control and Learning, Introduction to Research in Kinesiology, Introduction to Statistical Inquiry, \u200bHuman Anatomy and Physiology I\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ScienceFirst year Degree Guide - KinesiologyProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

Can I know there is a world outside my mind? Does God exist?\nPhilosophy asks fundamental questions about ourselves, the world, and our place within it. As a philosophy student, you'll learn how to think, discuss and write about abstract ideas. During the course of your studies, you'll gain abstract reasoning skills, conceptual analysis capabilities, written and verbal communication skills, and logical abilities.\nCareer opportunities\nAs a Philosophy graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in Philosophy can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nHonours Degree - In-depth study of a specific topic completed under the supervision of a faculty member.\nMinor in the History and Philosophy of Science: An introduction to the ideas and history behind science; an excellent background option for careers in science administration and science writing.\nConcentration in Law and Philosophy: A concentration that provides the courses and degree credit to help build the necessary skills for a legal career.\nConcentration in Religion and Philosophy: An interdisciplinary option for students completing a BA in philosophy or religion\nCourses in this program\nSex, Love  Death; How Do We Know?; Philosophy of Money; Law and Morality; Science and Philosophy; Logic\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ArtsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

How do quarks decay?\nPhysics is the study of laws that govern the behaviour and interaction of energy and matter. Physicists seek to understand the ways that matter and energy interact through experiment, observation and mathematical models. Physical interactions are fundamental to many phenomena in Nature and form the basis of our understanding of the universe. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the laboratory. This degree will provide you with a strong foundation in applied mathematics, chemistry, physics, advanced physics and applied physics.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bPhysicists have global opportunities to work in areas such as aerodynamics, technological design, quantitative finance, medical physics, and more.

How does aging affect brain function? Why do people offer help to strangers?\nPsychology is the scientific study of the biological, cognitive, emotional, and social bases of behaviour. There is a strong emphasis on written and verbal communication, as well as statistical analysis and research skills. Students who are interested in gaining experience with psychology research may pursue opportunities to work in research laboratories, either as a volunteer or as part of research courses. Psychology majors will gain a deeper understanding of the biological, cognitive, emotional, and social influences on the human experience. They will also gain experience in thinking critically and solving problems, conducting research and analyzing data, and communicating effectively as well as develop skills in information literacy, implementing ethical principles, and applying psychological knowledge and skills to personal, social, organizational, and societal problems.\nYou can earn both a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science\u00a0in Psychology\u00a0and a Bachelor of Community Rehabilitation\u00a0in just five years through our combined degree program.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bAs a psychology graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in psychology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education. Many of our graduated go on to pursue advanced graduate degrees to prepare them for careers as clinical psychologists, professors/academics, applied researchers or organizational consultants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nHonours Degree - In-depth study of a specific topic completed under the supervision of a faculty member.\nField school - Discipline-specific classes taken in real-world settings, and involving hands-on course work.\nCourses in this program\nDevelopmental Psychology, History of Psychological Thought, Psychology of Brain and Behaviour, Social Psychology, \u200bPrinciples of Psychology I\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ArtsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",

How is loss data analyzed? What is the best way to develop a loss prevention strategy?\nRisk management involves formally identifying and evaluating risk and choosing the most efficient way to pay for and recover from potential loss. One method often considered to handle potential losses is insurance, which is the organized sharing of losses across individuals and companies. Over the course of your studies you'll develop an understanding of the risk management process, insurance products for business, and insurance company operations. You'll complete formal presentations, group projects and various case studies during your degree.\nCareer opportunities\nAs a graduate of the Bachelor of Commerce degree with a concentration in risk management and insurance, you'll be prepared for global career opportunities in the areas of banking, underwriting, insurance, and more. A degree in commerce can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nCollaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.\nCo-operative work placement - Gain valuable full-time paid work experience that alternates with your academic studies.\nStudy abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.\nMentorship opportunities - A formal or informal relationship where you connect with, and learn from, an established professional.\nCourses in this program\nIntroduction to Business Analytics, Introduction to Business Skills, Introduction to Risk Management and Insurance, Principles of Macroeconomics, \u200bPrinciples of Microeconomics\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - BusinessDegree Concentrations (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b\nDegree Concentrations (additional information)",

Does public art reduce crime rates?\nUrban Studies is a broad interdisciplinary program designed to provide an integrated understanding of the social, political, economic, environmental and cultural processes that shape urban life, with particular attention paid to how these processes operate in space and time. Cities are sites of great cultural and ethnic diversity, economic innovation and inequality, cultural expression, resource consumption, wealth generation, and political conflict and cooperation. Today most developed societies are predominantly urban, even as global processes increasingly shape them. The processes that shape urban life play a critical role in shaping the sustainability of societies. Indeed, it is impossible to understand sustainability issues without understanding the organization of cities. The Urban Studies program provides a strong background for students interested in working in both public and private sector fields including urban and regional planning, public policy, architecture, environmental design, economic development, city administration, social services, cultural programming, urban politics, law, and education.\nCareer opportunities\n\u200bAs an Urban Studies graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in Urban Studies can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.Introduction to Geospatial Methods, Introduction to Social and Cultural Anthropology, The Gendered City, The Human Environment, \u200bIntroduction to Cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram highlights\nCo-operative work placement - Gain valuable full-time paid work experience that alternates with your academic studies.\nHonours Degree - In-depth study of a specific topic completed under the supervision of a faculty member.\nField school - Discipline-specific classes taken in real-world settings, and involving hands-on course work.\nCourses in this program\nIntroduction to Cities, Planning in the Canadian City, Architecture and the Future of Cities, Geospatial Communication, Urban Social Geography, Social Research Methods\nDetailed course information\nFirst year Degree Guide - ArtsProgram Description (Course Calendar)List of Courses in the Program\u200b",
