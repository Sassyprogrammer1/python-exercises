Achieve your goals at your own pace with online and on campus course options and flexible program completion timelines.\nThe RNS program has received both the Award of Excellence from the Canadian Association for University Continuing Education (2001) and the Ecostar Award for Environmental Education from the Capital Regional District (2005).\nThe program can be taken part-time or full-time.\n\nProgram information session\nJoin us for a free 30-minute Zoom information session where we will introduce you to the RNS program as a whole and outline the differences between the two streams. Learn about the program strengths, where our students typically find work and explore if this program is right for you.\nView information session details\nProgram features\n\nA holistic approach to ecological restoration\nFlexible program completion timelines\nCombination of on-campus intensive and online course formats\nCourses instructed by restoration professionals\nDifferent perspectives come together as part of a shared vision\nA recognized university credential for professionals",
