We offer a wide variety of language courses and you\u2019re able to choose from academic paths in linguistics, literature or translation.\nIn language courses, you study and practise the techniques and structures of French. Francophone literature is a vast domain, covering a wide range of countries and spanning many centuries. You\u2019ll learn to analyze literary texts, as well as scholarly materials and research literature, enhancing your ability to read, understand, enjoy and appraise written French.\nAs North America\u2019s capital of French culture, Montreal is a living lab. You\u2019ll connect with Quebec culture, tradition, history and literature as well as with a diverse French-speaking community from around the world.\nWhether you want to work in science, culture or business, advanced training in French is a valuable linguistic asset in Canada, an essential tool for living in Quebec, and a ticket to roam la francophonie.",

In a world where our ideas about sexuality are being contested and transformed, an interdisciplinary academic approach anchors knowledge as you develop insight into the complex and sometimes contradictory understandings of sexuality across history and in diverse contexts today.\nAreas of focus include the study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, intersex, queer, asexual, heterosexual, pansexual, monogamous, non-monogamous and polyamourous lives, at the intersections of feminism, gender, race, class, politics, culture and more. Courses highlight Indigenous, Black,\u00a0people of colour,\u00a0migrant, diasporic, transnational, decolonizing, postcolonial, disability and other critical frameworks, and you\u2019ll cross traditional disciplinary boundaries by engaging with sexuality in areas like art history, film, biology, religion and sociology, to name just a few.\nMontreal is a diverse city and through\u00a0practicum placements (available to students in the major program), you'll have the opportunity to gain first-hand experience with many different communities that shape the arts, public health, advocacy and activism.",

The mental agility you develop as a jazz musician is matched only by your dexterity as a performer, your audacity as a composer, and your skills as an arranger.\nStudents in the Jazz Studies program, the first university-level jazz program created in Canada, have a unique opportunity to become fully immersed in the sounds and traditions of a 100 year-old art form that\u2019s truly modern and still evolving. From jazz language and composition to theory classes, you\u2019ll learn music in an environment that\u2019s grounded in the traditions and leading the next wave.\nIn the heart of downtown Montreal, a vibrant metropolis with a deep jazz tradition, you\u2019ll have enormous opportunity for cross-pollination with other university-level jazz students across the city. And you\u2019ll be in a rich environment for jamming and seeing the best acts in the world perform at one of the city\u2019s jazz clubs.",

When you study photography, you\u2019re exposed to digital and film-based photographic practices. You\u2019ll learn camera and darkroom techniques for colour and black-and-white prints, digital photography tools and printing skills. You\u2019ll also take courses that give you:\n\nAn historical and theoretical understanding of the medium\nConcepts and vocabulary to discuss photography critically\nA social and aesthetic base to look at photography's social and artistic impact\nA broad understanding of how to construct contemporary images\n\nYou\u2019ll leave us as a fine arts photographer, able to control the camera to express yourself, to produce a coherent body of work and to take your skills into many creative enterprises.",

We typically offer over\u202f50\u202fundergraduate art history courses each year.\u202fFurthermore, our course offerings are continuously being\u202fchanged and\u202fupdated to include new approaches to studying art.\nBeginning in their second year, students can register for upper-level seminars, which allow smaller groups of students to join a professor in exploring a special topic or research question. (Some recent special topics: Looted Art; Ethics and Contemporary Craft; Art and Ritual in Medieval Europe; Queering Modernism). As a complement to classroom activities, internships in museums or art galleries offer hands-on, experiential learning.",

Use the metal or wood shops to build 3D prototypes, for example, or use professional equipment for specialty bookbinding or video editing.\nMore people in Montreal work in creative jobs than anywhere else in the world after London. The city has a vibrant market for locally created products and it\u2019s also a place where sustainability is part of the public conversation, making for a stimulating environment to think about and work in design.",

As you examine South Asian influences on the West, including yoga, meditation, and Buddhist concepts, you will challenge your own ideas and discover alternative worldviews.\nExplore Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism, and South Asian expressions of Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Sufism as you discover or enhance your knowledge of languages including Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Tibetan, and Sanskrit. \u00a0Through Concordia International, go on exchange in a South Asian country.

By developing an informed appreciation of different cultures and values, you\u2019ll position yourself to engage with the world as a truly global citizen \u2013 and gain insight into your own assumptions, as an individual and a member of a group. If you consider yourself a social activist, the programs in Religions and Cultures may be the place for you!\nThe study of religion at Concordia is characterized by a deep respect for diversity of culture, gender, and sexual orientation and by an emphasis on field work. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to visit places of worship and meet people connected to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism in Montreal.\u00a0 You will have the opportunity to study languages spoken across the world.",

We can choose to live in ignorance of history, but we cannot live independently of it. History, in other words, is a burden we all share, but for some of us it is also a resource. It imposes limits but also supplies opportunities.\nHistory is more than mere facts; it is a dynamic discipline built on analysis, debate and interpretation. When you study history, you develop a cultural vocabulary that examines humanity through events, culture and context. Our modern multimedia facilities bring history to life through images, texts, and sound recordings. Our faculty specialize in areas that reflect the world\u2019s diversity. Whether your heart lies in modern Africa, medieval England or contemporary Japan, you will have the opportunity to study the historical periods and geographical locations that capture your attention. Complement your studies with thematic courses such as film in history, gender, the history of peace and war or environmental history.",

As a Creative Writing student, you\u2019ll learn to approach literature from a writer\u2019s point of view as you develop your own craft under the guidance of published writers and fellow students.\nWhether it\u2019s through prose, poetry, or drama, our workshops help you find your voice and your subject. Creative writing students also have the opportunity to supplement their regular courses with master classes conducted by internationally renowned writers during the Writers Read at Concordia series. Concordia has hosted writers such as Julian Barnes, Dionne Brand, CAConrad, Roxane Gay, Renee Gladman, Jorie Graham, Ben Lerner, Daniel David Moses, Fred Moten, Claudia Rankine, George Saunders, A.E. Stallings, and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn.\nMontreal\u2019s vibrant English-language literary scene offers a showcase for the work of student writers as well as published authors. The skills acquired in our Creative Writing program can help prepare you for a professional life as a writer, editor, or publisher in print or in electronic media. The Honours in English and Creative Writing is a gateway to graduate study in literature or to further study in creative writing.",

Or they ask questions about what the mind, knowledge, science, identity, gender and sexuality really are. Whatever the issue, philosophers learn how to analyze ideas and arguments, and reason well. They also make discoveries about the history of ideas and how this shapes the way we think about contemporary life.\nStudying philosophy will open your eyes to these deep ideas and questions, teach you to analyze them with philosophical insight and rigour, to read, write and reason well, and build skills for speech and debate. As you reflect on the assumptions that inform our social, political, and scientific practices, you will think about, and relate to, the political, social and natural world in an entirely new way.\nAn undergraduate degree in philosophy is the stepping stone to graduate studies or a wide variety of careers that require critical thinking, careful writing, or superior communication skills.",

By systematically observing and investigating cultural life in diverse human societies, you\u2019ll understand the ways in which much of what we assume to be natural is, in fact, constructed by our culture.\nOnce you discover that family, art, politics or economics take many possible forms, your notion of what it means to be a person expands and grows. Through our courses, you\u2019ll examine the self and identity, look at large-scale research projects across cultures, and apply our methods to nearly any place \u2014 from Africa to the Middle East, or the Caribbean \u2014 to nearly any topic from medicine to gender, or myth.\nWe\u2019re known for encouraging our students to participate in local, national, and international research. You'll work on your own projects, and have the opportunity to work on faculty research. Anthropology teaches you critical skills that equip you to make informed decisions in any profession.",

In this program, you can study virtually every approach to painting and drawing, from traditional oil painting to graphic novel production and 3D spatial installation. Your technical, formal and conceptual skills will be developed through focused studio production and instruction in theory, art history and cultural studies.\nDrawing incorporates a wide array of materials and explores gesture, mark making, the construction of visual space, as well as symbol and storytelling. In Painting classes, you will explore colour use, paint application, tools and techniques along with the formal language of painting and its use in abstract, figurative and hybrid/expanded modes.\nAs active professional artists engaged at both an international and local level, our faculty bring insight into the exciting and complex world of art. You will gain the ability to think creatively and critically and to materialize your ideas in visual form. These skills sets, along with the development of visual literacy and expertise, can be applied to multiple professions in the visual arts.",

Regardless of your program you\u2019ll also:\n\nReceive fundamental training in statistics and research methods\nLearn the basic principles of behavioural neurobiology\nStudy the history of psychology\n\nA Psychology degree opens many doors; specialization or honours students may choose to work as a psychologist, therapist, or pursue graduate studies or medical research.

At the same time, grow into a well-rounded theatre artist by studying dramaturgy/script analysis, collaborative methods, theatre history and theory, and\u00a0scenographic\u00a0design fundamentals.\u00a0\nAs you move through the program, explore more advanced techniques and specialty skills, such as stage combat, theatrical Biomechanics, Viewpoints, singing, dialects, audition and camera, among others. Progress from acting styles rooted in psychological realism to range-expanding techniques based in psychophysical and non-realistic approaches. Apply your growing skillset by performing in productions of plays by great contemporary playwrights and iconic writers from the past. You\u2019ll also have opportunities to create and perform original work.\nThroughout your degree, gain exposure to the professional theatre scene in Montreal and beyond. You may do a supervised internship with an organization such as the Segal Centre, the Centaur Theatre, Geordie Theatre, and Bread and Puppet Theater. You may also have the chance to participate in an international exchange program or field schools; recent opportunities have included programs in Chinese opera in Beijing, and post-dramatic theatre in Germany.\u00a0\nBy the end of the program, you\u2019ll emerge with a clear sense of your own theatrical identity. You\u2019ll know what kind of work you want to do and what kind of stories you\u2019re inspired to tell, and you\u2019ll have the confidence, abilities, and artistic daring to step into a professional career.",

How can we engineer microbes to produce new drugs or develop sustainable technologies? How can we develop better conservation strategies based on our understanding of the genetic diversity within a species?\nThe potential to explore these questions has exploded in our modern age of big data and data analytics. Thanks to advances in scientific and digital technologies, we can now collect vast amounts of information about biological systems, revolutionizing our ability to understand the world around us. But in order to access the insights offered by massive data sets, researchers need the language and tools of computer science.\nThe BSc in Systems and Information Biology will place you at the rich intersection of biology and computer science. Through lectures, labs and research projects, you will learn how to use computational and bioinformatic approaches to explore the biological sciences. Depending on your path through the program, you will learn about:\n\nmolecular and cell biology\ncomputer coding and algorithms relevant to the biological sciences\ngenomics and biological data sciences\nmathematics, statistics, and modelling\necology and evolutionary biology\n\nConcordia\u2019s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for a career in the life sciences or environmental sciences, or paves the way for future graduate studies.\nStudents who are more interested in studying these issues with a foundation in computer science may wish to consider the BCompSc in Health and Life Sciences.",

It goes without saying that, as a literature student, you'll sharpen your abilities as a critical reader, thinker and writer.\nIn a curriculum that stretches through time and spans the globe, you will study texts ranging from Old and Middle English to contemporary post-colonial voices from around the world. You'll also study literary theories and models of interpretation, and develop indispensable communication, research, analytic, and rhetorical skills.\nAfter graduation, you will leave with the knowledge and skill for any career that values critical thinking and superior communication skills.",

Not limited to a single orientation or medium, our program\u2019s exploratory approach to sculpture provides for a stimulating learning environment. From object-making to performance-based installations, students develop their individual interests through this malleable discipline. Our courses give students exposure to metal work, woodwork, moulding and casting, bronze and aluminum foundry work, public art practices, environmentally sustainable techniques, as well as a wide range of diverse materials and digital technologies.\nOur program features:\u00a0\n\nStudent-centered curriculum, with an emphasis on the personal interests of the students\nProfessional internships and other opportunities\nUpcoming renovations to sculpture studios and foundry facilities, and a dedicated student exhibition space\u00a0\nHands-on courses focusing on technical and conceptual development\n24-hour access to Sculpture Studios\nActive Association of Undergrad Sculpture Students (A.U.S.) with a dedicated office space\n\nSculpture is a practice that addresses the way objects, space and human bodies coexist in the world. When you consider it this way, the medium becomes endlessly broad, as well as highly relevant to contemporary life. Critical analysis skills are developed through making things. In a sculpture program, thinking and making go hand-in-hand.",

So if you\u2019re ready, sharpen your reasoning skills and open your mind \u2014 physics is a discipline that demands as much curiosity as it does strength in mathematics.\nAs a Physics student, you\u2019ll choose the Physics option, or examine the role of physics in the life sciences in the Biophysics option. You\u2019ll receive a thorough foundation in all branches of physics, including mathematics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves and optics, quantum mechanics and modern and theoretical physics.\nGraduates leave the program with the knowledge and creative thinking skills required for graduate studies or a career in the pure or life sciences.",

Statisticians also conduct surveys, analyze data, devise new methods of analysis and give advice on the statistical results of experiments such as clinical trials. Though it\u2019s impossible to predict the future with 100 per cent accuracy, studying statistics will teach you creative problem solving, abstract thinking and analytical skills.\nWhen you study statistics, you learn to uncover the mathematical structure of random systems such as the economy, health and survival, the weather, and the stock market. You will also receive a solid foundation in linear algebra, calculus, probability and computational methods and learn to use professional software tools for mathematics and data analysis applications.\nAn undergraduate degree in statistics prepares students for graduate work in statistics or in a professional career in business, industry, medical research or government agencies.",

Developing a cultural vocabulary will allow you to engage with the modern media environment critically, and interpret the political and ideological orientations of the messages we consume.\nThe Major in Communication and Cultural Studies is excellent preparation for graduate studies in either subject.

By interacting with other belief systems and staying open to diverse interpretations of the Bible, you\u2019ll reflect on your own beliefs and deepen your intellectual understanding of religion.\nTheological Studies gives you the tools to have an informed discussion about God, and to address the 21st-century challenges transforming religious faith. You learn creative scholarly methods to examine classical and contemporary theology historically, philosophically, and scripturally. Theology will intersect with the social sciences and other humanist disciplines. You\u2019ll pursue your own theological quest and goals through six areas within Theological Studies:\n\nBiblical studies\nHistory of Christianity\nChristian ethics\nSystematic theology\nSpirituality\nChurch and state relations\n\nOur program gives you concrete tools and skills to engage in many different professions: teaching, research, pastoral ministry, government or non-government positions. It also opens doors to graduate studies.",

In addition to translation courses, you take language, linguistics and literature courses to sharpen your skills and acquire a high level of proficiency in reading and writing.\nOur program is officially recognized by the Canadian Association of Schools of Translation\u00a0(CAT).

You\u2019ll learn to analyze literary texts, as well as scholarly materials and research literature, enhancing your ability to read, understand, enjoy and appraise written French.\nAs North America\u2019s capital of French culture, Montreal is a living lab. You\u2019ll connect with Quebec culture, tradition, history and literature as well as with a diverse French-speaking community from around the world.\nWhether you want to work in science, culture or business, advanced training in French is a valuable linguistic asset in Canada, an essential tool for living in Quebec, and a ticket to roam la francophonie.",
