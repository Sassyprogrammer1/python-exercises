Students can transfer to this program if they wish to complete the Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice.\nEngineers and Medical Scientists are the leaders of developing, engineering, and implementing solutions to health and medical problems having an impact globally on the health of society. This combined degree is designed to provide opportunities for students interested in medical science, the scientific basis of engineering and technology, and the technology itself.\nThere is a strong interrelation between the progress of engineering and developments in science, and a demonstrated need for professionals with a strong understanding and experience in both areas. Engineers with Medical Scientist training have careers that are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, writing and implementing policy and practice in the medical and health sciences, to working in industry, government, and the innovation sector. This course allows choice or majors within both the Medical Scientist and Engineering programs, so students can specialise to their interests.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) program has a core taken by all engineering students which provides the foundation knowledge and skills required of every engineer. Students choose a major which is where they develop the technical knowledge specific to that field of practice. There is a choice of ten majors including Biomedical, Civil, Data, Electrical, Mechanical, Software, and a Flexible major that can be paired with the choice of major in the Bachelor of Medical Science to create a study trajectory that aligns with the student\u2019s interests and career ambitions.\nMedical Scientists at UTS can choose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Sciences major students will learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students will learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories and studios with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, innovation and team-work to deliver impact across local and global communities.\nA strong professional focus ensures graduates of this course learn the skills employers want with a solid link between theory and practice and the benefits of hands-on experience. Students explore and investigate the human body's structure, function and disease processes at the cellular and whole organ level. In the engineering program students build strong foundations in engineering theory, technical expertise and knowledge of professional practice. The course provides the knowledge and skills for students to be excellent medical scientists and engineers, who can make a difference to society in a range of careers.\nThis combined degree can be completed in less time than would be required to complete the two degrees separately.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-bachelor-medical-science-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"46690\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

This combined degree is designed to provide opportunities for students interested in medical science, the scientific basis of engineering and technology, and the technology itself.\nThere is a strong interrelation between the progress of engineering and developments in science, and a demonstrated need for professionals with a strong understanding and experience in both areas. Engineers with Medical Scientist training have careers that are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, writing and implementing policy and practice in the medical and health sciences, to working in industry, government, and the innovation sector. This course allows choice or majors within both the Medical Scientist and Engineering programs, so students can specialise to their interests.\nThe Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) program has a core taken by all engineering students which provides the foundation knowledge and skills required of every engineer. Students choose a major which is where they develop the technical knowledge specific to that field of practice. There is a choice of ten majors including Biomedical, Civil, Data, Electrical, Mechanical, Software, and a Flexible major that can be paired with the choice of major in the Bachelor of Medical Science to create a study trajectory that aligns with the student\u2019s interests and career ambitions.\nMedical Scientists at UTS can choose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories and studios with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, innovation and team-work to deliver impact across local and global communities.\nA strong professional focus ensures graduates of this course learn the skills employers want with a solid link between theory and practice and the benefits of hands-on experience. Students explore and investigate the human body's structure, function and disease processes at the cellular and whole organ level. In the engineering program students build strong foundations in engineering theory, technical expertise and knowledge of professional practice. The course provides the knowledge and skills for students to be excellent medical scientists and engineers, who can make a difference to society in a range of careers.\nThis combined degree can be completed in less time than would be required to complete the two degrees separately.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-bachelor-medical-science", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"46690\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Students learn to deal with complex systems and manage large-scale projects using the most appropriate emerging technologies.\nThe course offers an authentic, professionally focused and practice-based education program with two sessions of internship (normally paid) in a real workplace setting. A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"50000\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

In the BCII, students use design processes to engage with industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals. The law component of this degree offers fieldwork, leadership, mooting and mentoring opportunities, and meets the academic requirements for admission to practise law in NSW. Students can also enrol in the Legal Futures and Technology major, which provides a future-focused look at the technologies shaping the legal profession.\nBy the end of the course, students have the skills to engage in critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines.\nGraduates have the capacity to take a contemporary and solutions-focused approach to a career in law, or to use their legal expertise as a solid foundation for entrepreneurial, collaborative, strategic or analytical positions across a range of professional sectors.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-laws-bachelor-creative-intelligence-and-innovation", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"48020\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Medical Scientists at UTS can chose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have a speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students also learn how to identify infectious agents and the latest approaches to prevent, treat infections and limit their impact on society. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation.\nWith the Bachelor of Medical Science Bachelor of Laws, students can prepare for specialist roles in the field of health care law or opt to pursue two discrete qualifications in medical science and law. Elective subjects in biomedicine, mental health or intellectual property tailor the degree to either a health care or research focus, or students can pursue a broad introduction to a range of health and law concepts by choosing subjects that correspond to their individual interests.\nThe Legal Futures and Technology major enables the development of niche expertise in emerging technologies that are impacting the legal sector, such as smart contracts, AI and blockchain.

The medical science program is designed to educate and train graduates for careers in medical and health-related sciences or pathology depending on their major choice. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation that means the students are ideally placed for a range of professions.\nIn the International Studies, students select one of six languages (Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, or Spanish) and one of the following three pathways: Language, Culture  the Professional World, Language; Culture  Global Exchange; and International Honours.\nThe combination of medical science and international studies aims to produce graduates with an increased awareness of the international contexts of health and who are well prepared to pursue global health-related professional careers. The course provides the knowledge and skills for students to be excellent medical scientists, but also with an excellent language and international skills set, meaning graduates can make a difference to society in a range of careers with a global and international context.\nMultinational pharmaceutical companies look to medical science graduates to work in drug registration, clinical trials coordination, as technical or marketing representatives and as policy analysts. International health initiatives involving governments or non-government organisations also look for the unique skills provided by this dual degree.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-medical-science-bachelor-international-studies", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

With the UTS Bachelor of Science, students can take their place at the forefront of a profession with the power to build resilience in both humanity and the planet.\nThis flagship degree has been designed with flexibility in mind: with eight majors to choose from and extensive elective blocks on offer, students can build a degree that\u2019s uniquely theirs. In their first year, they gain access to the \u2018scientist\u2019s toolkit\u2019, a series of core subjects designed to help them critically analyse the ways in which science can help solve global problems.\nFrom there, they can dive into specialist science subjects in their chosen major, working in world-class facilities and on industry-standard equipment. Our practice-based learning approach means students learn by doing, translating scientific theory into real-world practice. But they don\u2019t just do it in the classroom: extensive professional experiences, from internships and field trips to global exchange placements, help bring their learning to life.\nScience is about more than just what happens in the lab. UTS science students pair the study of hard science with the development of crucial professional skills \u2013 inquiry, reflection, innovation and communication \u2013 that prepare them for a diverse and thriving career.\nWhat you\u2019ll study\nStudents can choose from eight majors from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences or Life Sciences stream and build specialist skills in their chosen scientific discipline.\nMathematical and Physical Sciences\nLife Sciences", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Medical Scientists with Business strengths are the leaders of creating, and developing and taking to the public or market, solutions to health and medical problems. Medical Scientists careers are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, business, writing and implementing policy and practice in the medical and health sciences, and communicating science. In the medical scientists component of this degree students choose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation that means the students are ideally placed for a range of professions.\nThe aim of this combined degree is to produce graduates with professional qualifications in both medical science and business, to enable them to practise in both areas. Graduates who can cross the divide between medical science and business are highly sought after by employers because they not only have scientific and business skills, but also have transferable skills such as analytical, critical thinking and communication skills.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-medical-science-bachelor-business", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

course (undergraduate + postgraduate degree) enables students to gain a greater depth of disciplinary knowledge in science before commencing the teaching subjects in the Master of Teaching from their second year of study. Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in their field of study gives them more confidence when commencing as a teacher. Students enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.\nThe unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.\nTo ensure that a high quality of teachers are maintained in the education sector, students need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into the final years of the program.\nIf students do not meet the Credit average, they will still be able to continue in the Bachelor of Science and graduate with that qualification.\nStudents spend 80 days in one of more than 200 secondary schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps students gain the skills and confidence incurriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in their chosen discipline/s (Junior Science Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Physics and/or Mathematics), and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.\nNot only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they have the benefits of a range of career options.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science-master-teaching-secondary-education", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

The Bachelor of Medical Science Bachelor of Laws (Honours) is offered jointly by UTS Law and UTS Science. Honours relates to the law component only and students must successfully complete both of the research subjects: 76090 Research Methodology and 76040 Research Thesis. Strong research skills are valued highly in contemporary professional practice.\nMedical Scientists with Law training have careers that are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, policy and practice in the medical and Health and Sciences, government, industrial and commercial applications of medical science and law. Medical Scientists at UTS can chose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have a speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students also learn how to identify infectious agents and the latest approaches to prevent, treat infections and limit their impact on society. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation.\nThe program provides full-time study for students wishing to obtain a professional legal qualification that satisfies the academic requirements only for admission as a lawyer together with specialisation in medical science.\nThe course addresses the increasing need for medical science expertise among lawyers. Graduates develop critical and analytical skills inherent to an understanding of the complex links between medical science and the law, thus increasing their employment opportunities and career choices. Students have the opportunity to engage in deeper study of the law by studying 76090 Research Methodology and undertaking 76040 Research Thesis.

The medical science program is designed to educate and train graduates for careers in medical and health-related sciences or pathology depending on their major choice. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation that means the students are ideally placed for a range of professions.\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\nThe combination of medical science and international studies aims to produce graduates with an increased awareness of the international contexts of health and who are well prepared to pursue global health-related professional careers. The course provides the knowledge and skills for students to be excellent medical scientists, but also with an excellent language and international skills set, meaning graduates can make a difference to society in a range of careers with a global and international context.\nMultinational pharmaceutical companies look to medical science graduates to work in drug registration, clinical trials coordination, as technical or marketing representatives and as policy analysts. International health initiatives involving governments or non-government organisations also look for the unique skills provided by this dual degree.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-medical-science-bachelor-international-studies-honours", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Bachelor of Information Technology Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Information Technology Bachelor of International Studies (C10239).\nThis course integrates a professional degree in information technology with the study of a language and culture other than English and the opportunity for students to study overseas for up to an academic year, pursuing a major research project in a field of their choice, depending on their chosen pathway.\nThe information technology component provides a sound education in all aspects of computing and information technology for a career in the profession.\nThe international studies component offers an in-depth understanding of diverse cultures through academic learning at UTS and the host institution during study abroad.\nStudents choose an IT major and are allocated to a country major as part of the Bachelor of International Studies.\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\nThe course adopts a practice-based approach to IT education and the course content is designed with a mix of theory and practice. As well as gaining strong technical skills in IT, students gain skills in business analysis, problem-solving, teamwork and communication. Employers look for graduates with industry experience and, in this course, students are exposed to real IT problems.\nThe international studies component of this course means that graduates have the added advantage of being well prepared to participate in a global workforce and a diverse range of IT careers and companies.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-information-technology-bachelor-international-studies-honours", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"48020\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Bachelor of Communication (Social and Political Sciences) at UTS is designed for those passionate about influencing key areas of public policy like climate change, human rights or issues facing Indigenous Australians and migrants. In the course, students explore current social issues, investigate society and analyse the implications of change in Australian and global communities. In this practice-led course, students work with experienced practitioners to develop their skills as researchers, analysts, critical thinkers, effective communicators and advocates, and bring key policy issues to life with their interpersonal and public communication skills.\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nThe Bachelor of Communication (Social and Political Sciences) will provide students with a theoretical framework rooted in historical and philosophical perspectives on how societies function, bolstering this with applied learning in qualitative and quantitative research methods. Students learn how to tackle key social issues and make a real difference through research and communication, contributing to new and ongoing debates.

They discover how to think creatively and develop ideas through multiple stages, focusing upon character development, narrative structure and engaging performance. They also learn fundamental 2D, 3D and hybrid animation skills to bring their stories to life.\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nGraduates from the Bachelor of Animation Production are image-makers, critical thinkers and storytellers in equal measure and we help equip them to become leaders in this industry. Students will learn to develop, pitch and defend ideas, and ultimately create original content for film, TV, advertising and other screen-based media that will engage global audiences.\nOne of the benefits of studying our Bachelor of Animation Production is the link to UTS\u2019s existing industry connections that help give students that competitive advantage. Students have the opportunity to work with live projects and active partners, such as ABC Podcasts, VIVID, the Australia Piano Quartet, and other collaborations with international universities at the Annecy MIFA campus etc. UTS also has long-standing relationships with Sydney's local animation studios such as Flying Bark Productions, Mighty Nice, Cheeky Little Media, Dave Enterprises, and Animal Logic which offer students multiple opportunities to engage in practice while studying.\nUTS understands that teamwork is at the heart of the animation industry which is why a studio-led approach is used to create a high-intensity practical environment where students learn how to work with their peers in a professional and collaborative atmosphere, melding creativity, technology and research.\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own, across and between other disciplines.

Featuring a strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, this course provides a compelling combination of conceptual rigour and practical knowledge, which includes opportunities for internships with industry partners and overseas exchange placements with university partners.\nThe creative intelligence focus of the program propels students to \u2018think differently\u2019 and to experience a new form of education. Instead of lectures and tutorials, students do hackathons, think tanks, and hot housing days in a creative lab environment during their winter and summer schools. They take ideas for a walk and trial speculative scenarios \u2013 they undertake thought experiments and engage in carefully-designed sandpit environments with creative methods and practices from across the disciplines.\nIn summary, this combined degree brings together multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating insights from the entertainment and experience industries, this allowing for the cultivation of real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the \u2018wicked\u2019 problems, complex challenges, and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of this combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities which are highly valued in the globalised world, including critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work independently across disciplines.

Students should develop flexibility and confidence in working across the diverse environments that constitute contemporary practice.\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nThe course centres on design studios which integrate practice-oriented learning about specific fashion and textile projects, and parallels the process that professionals undertake in industry. There is strong emphasis on creativity, experimentation and future thinking in the fashion industry. Professional practice is embedded in all fashion studios and builds on contemporary industry practice with a focus on international fashion markets. Projects are developed through individual and group work, and are often tied to external projects with industry or cultural partners.\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines.

Medical Scientists with Business strengths are the leaders of creating, and developing and taking to the public or market, solutions to health and medical problems. Medical Scientists careers are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, business, writing and implementing policy and practice in the medical and health sciences, and communicating science. In the medical scientists component of this degree students choose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation that means the students are ideally placed for a range of professions.\nThe aim of this combined degree is to produce graduates with professional qualifications in both medical science and business, to enable them to practise in both areas. Graduates who can cross the divide between medical science and business are highly sought after by employers because they not only have scientific and business skills, but also have transferable skills such as analytical, critical thinking and communication skills.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-medical-science-bachelor-business", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

The degree provides the conceptual knowledge and garment-making skills required to transform a creative vision into compelling fashion statements. Sustainability and social justice are threaded throughout the course.\nWhile UTS recognises that a commercial framework is important, students are encouraged to become industry leaders through a focus on innovation, experimentation, systems thinking and futuring methodologies. They have full access to world-class textile and fashion workshops, working under the close supervision of expert staff. This experimental spirit is balanced by close industry ties. Students get the opportunity to work on real-world projects with brands such as Australian Wool Innovation, Liberty London, ISKO Denim and Swarovski.\nUTS also understands that the fashion industry is as much about people as it is about garments: through studio work and subjects in Design Studies students gain the communication and teamwork skills to develop, articulate and present their ideas to peers and industry. Graduates are recognised globally and many have gone on to work or study overseas, including fashion capitals London, New York, Tokyo and Milan.

Students wishing to qualify for professional recognition as architects must also complete the Master of Architecture (C04235).\nThrough the Bachelor of Design in Architecture, students learn what it means to be an architect in a globalised world. This is achieved with a focus on how the profession can shape global cities through complex spatial thinking.\nThe first step is to deprogram preconceived ideas of architecture. Such an approach lays the foundations for creative spatial and material awareness, pushing the boundaries of traditional architectural practice.\nUTS takes a hands-on approach to digital design and fabrication: students learn the software, material and model-making skills required to translate thought into form, right from the start. They have the opportunity to work on real-life projects and engage with stakeholders such as the Powerhouse Museum, ABC, Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA), and Sydney Olympic Park Authority.\nStudents are globally connected, with opportunities to study in, work in or visit cities such as Berlin, Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo. They hear from international experts through guest lectures and are connected to global competitions and scholarships like the Cosentino Design Challenge or Frank Gehry internship program.\nUTS Architecture is a vibrant architecture school, situated in one of Australia's newest, leading-edge campuses. Its staff are actively engaged in the industry as practitioners, researchers, and commentators, while its 24-hour studios are always abuzz with students who live and breathe architecture.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-design-architecture", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"39490\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Contemporary societies and city environments are changing rapidly, and this course promotes the ability to adapt to this change and shape the way people experience interior and public spaces.\nThrough a strong emphasis on practice and research, students develop the ability to think conceptually and understand the complex contexts in which they are designing. Through intensive collaborative design studios, students work to develop, discuss and debate ideas as they would in industry. With skills in analogue and digital design and fabrication, they are able to tackle real-world projects in the studios as well as through competitions with stakeholders such as the Art Gallery of NSW, Object Gallery, the City of Sydney and Zumtobel Lighting.\nInternational connections and focus encourage recognition of UTS graduates abroad.

property sector, with skills in property valuation, market analysis, investment and development. Their skill set is just as relevant locally as it is internationally.\nThis degree covers economic, legal and financial disciplines, giving students the flexibility to pursue a variety of career paths. This business knowledge is also transferable, providing options for a transition to other sectors as careers develop.\nUTS graduates are highly sought after and have excellent starting salaries: the property industry actively recruits property economics students. Most students are working in the industry by their third year of study.\nThis job-readiness results from UTS's industry connections: the curriculum was developed in consultation with industry, guest lecturers come from industry, and students work with real-world projects such as Barangaroo, Central Park and Green Square.\nThe degree structures classes so that students do a mixture of individual and team-based work, mixing theory and practice.

They discover how to think creatively and develop ideas through multiple stages, focusing upon character development, narrative structure and engaging performance. They also learn fundamental 2D, 3D and hybrid animation skills to bring their stories to life.\nThis degree combines a professional degree with language and culture studies, enhancing professional training and career options by providing students with the opportunity to undertake studies at an overseas University.\nGraduates from the Bachelor of Animation Production are image-makers, critical thinkers and storytellers in equal measure and we help equip them to become leaders in this industry. Students will learn to develop, pitch and defend ideas, and ultimately create original content for film, TV, advertising and other screen-based media that will engage global audiences.\nOne of the benefits of studying our Bachelor of Animation Production is the link to UTS\u2019s existing industry connections that help give students that competitive advantage. Students have the opportunity to work with live projects and active partners, such as ABC Podcasts, VIVID, the Australia Piano Quartet, and other collaborations with international universities at the Annecy MIFA campus etc. UTS also has long-standing relationships with Sydney's local animation studios such as Flying Bark Productions, Mighty Nice, Cheeky Little Media, Dave Enterprises, and Animal Logic which offer students multiple opportunities to engage in practice while studying.\nUTS understands that teamwork is at the heart of the animation industry which is why a studio-led approach is used to create a high-intensity practical environment where students learn how to work with their peers in a professional and collaborative atmosphere, melding creativity, technology and research.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-animation-production-bachelor-international-studies", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"42800\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

They discover how to think creatively and develop ideas through multiple stages, focusing upon character development, narrative structure and engaging performance. They also learn fundamental 2D, 3D and hybrid animation skills to bring their stories to life.\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nGraduates from the Bachelor of Animation Production are image-makers, critical thinkers and storytellers in equal measure and we help equip them to become leaders in this industry. Students will learn to develop, pitch and defend ideas, and ultimately create original content for film, TV, advertising and other screen-based media that will engage global audiences.\nOne of the benefits of studying our Bachelor of Animation Production is the link to UTS\u2019s existing industry connections that help give students that competitive advantage. Students have the opportunity to work with live projects and active partners, such as ABC Podcasts, VIVID, the Australia Piano Quartet, and other collaborations with international universities at the Annecy MIFA campus etc. UTS also has long-standing relationships with Sydney's local animation studios such as Flying Bark Productions, Mighty Nice, Cheeky Little Media, Dave Enterprises, and Animal Logic which offer students multiple opportunities to engage in practice while studying.\nUTS understands that teamwork is at the heart of the animation industry which is why a studio-led approach is used to create a high-intensity practical environment where students learn how to work with their peers in a professional and collaborative atmosphere, melding creativity, technology and research.\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own, across and between other disciplines.

A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations.

In their first year, they gain access to the \u2018scientist\u2019s toolkit\u2019, a series of core subjects designed to help them critically analyse the ways in which science can help solve global problems.\nFrom there, they can dive into specialist science subjects in their chosen major, working in world-class facilities and on industry-standard equipment. Our practice-based learning approach means students learn by doing, translating scientific theory into real-world practice. But they don\u2019t just do it in the classroom: extensive professional experiences, from internships and field trips to global exchange placements, help bring their learning to life.\nScience is about more than just what happens in the lab. UTS science students pair the study of hard science with the development of crucial professional skills \u2013 inquiry, reflection, innovation and communication \u2013 that prepare them for a diverse and thriving career.\nWhat you\u2019ll study\nStudents can choose from eight majors from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences or Life Sciences stream and build specialist skills in their chosen scientific discipline.\nMathematical and Physical Sciences\nLife Sciences", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"50000\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"50000\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"50000\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

In their first year, they gain access to the \u2018scientist\u2019s toolkit\u2019, a series of core subjects designed to help them critically analyse the ways in which science can help solve global problems.\nFrom there, they can dive into specialist science subjects in their chosen major, working in world-class facilities and on industry-standard equipment. Our practice-based learning approach means students learn by doing, translating scientific theory into real-world practice. But they don\u2019t just do it in the classroom: extensive professional experiences, from internships and field trips to global exchange placements, help bring their learning to life.\nScience is about more than just what happens in the lab. UTS science students pair the study of hard science with the development of crucial professional skills \u2013 inquiry, reflection, innovation and communication \u2013 that prepare them for a diverse and thriving career.\nWhat you\u2019ll study\nStudents can choose from eight majors from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences or Life Sciences stream and build specialist skills in their chosen scientific discipline.\nMathematical and Physical Sciences\nLife Sciences", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"50000\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

In their first year, they gain access to the \u2018scientist\u2019s toolkit\u2019, a series of core subjects designed to help them critically analyse the ways in which science can help solve global problems.\nFrom there, they can dive into specialist science subjects in their chosen major, working in world-class facilities and on industry-standard equipment. Our practice-based learning approach means students learn by doing, translating scientific theory into real-world practice. But they don\u2019t just do it in the classroom: extensive professional experiences, from internships and field trips to global exchange placements, help bring their learning to life.\nScience is about more than just what happens in the lab. UTS science students pair the study of hard science with the development of crucial professional skills \u2013 inquiry, reflection, innovation and communication \u2013 that prepare them for a diverse and thriving career.\nWhat you\u2019ll study\nStudents can choose from eight majors from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences or Life Sciences stream and build specialist skills in their chosen scientific discipline.\nMathematical and Physical Sciences\nLife Sciences", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-engineering-honours-diploma-professional-engineering-practice", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"50000\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

With the UTS Bachelor of Science, students can take their place at the forefront of a profession with the power to build resilience in both humanity and the planet.\nThis flagship degree has been designed with flexibility in mind: with eight majors to choose from and extensive elective blocks on offer, students can build a degree that\u2019s uniquely theirs. In their first year, they gain access to the \u2018scientist\u2019s toolkit\u2019, a series of core subjects designed to help them critically analyse the ways in which science can help solve global problems.\nFrom there, they can dive into specialist science subjects in their chosen major, working in world-class facilities and on industry-standard equipment. Our practice-based learning approach means students learn by doing, translating scientific theory into real-world practice. But they don\u2019t just do it in the classroom: extensive professional experiences, from internships and field trips to global exchange placements, help bring their learning to life.\nScience is about more than just what happens in the lab. UTS science students pair the study of hard science with the development of crucial professional skills \u2013 inquiry, reflection, innovation and communication \u2013 that prepare them for a diverse and thriving career.\nWhat you\u2019ll study\nStudents can choose from eight majors from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences or Life Sciences stream and build specialist skills in their chosen scientific discipline.\nMathematical and Physical Sciences\nLife Sciences", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in their field of study gives them more confidence when commencing as a teacher. Students enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.\nThe unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.\nTo ensure that a high quality of teachers are maintained in the education sector, students need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into the final years of the program.\nIf students do not meet the Credit average, they will still be able to continue in the Bachelor of Science and graduate with that qualification.\nStudents spend 80 days in one of more than 200 secondary schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps students gain the skills and confidence incurriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in their chosen discipline/s (Junior Science Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Physics and/or Mathematics), and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.\nNot only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they have the benefits of a range of career options.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-science-master-teaching-secondary-education", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"44240\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

knowledge alongside dynamic approaches to product and service design. This program goes well beyond the design-thinking and design-led innovation programmes now common in university environments to examine how innovation is led from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\nThe management focus of the program provides integrated exposure to the structure, function, and operation of the socio-culturally dynamic entertainment and experience industries, with a special focus on the visitor and audience economies of events, sport business, and the digital creative sector. Featuring a strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, this course provides a compelling combination of conceptual rigour and practical knowledge, which includes opportunities for internships with industry partners and overseas exchange placements with university partners.\nThe creative intelligence focus of the program propels students to \u2018think differently\u2019 and to experience a new form of education. Instead of lectures and tutorials, students do hackathons, think tanks, and hot housing days in a creative lab environment during their winter and summer schools. They take ideas for a walk and trial speculative scenarios \u2013 they undertake thought experiments and engage in carefully-designed sandpit environments with creative methods and practices from across the disciplines.\nIn summary, this combined degree brings together multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating insights from the entertainment and experience industries, this allowing for the cultivation of real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the \u2018wicked\u2019 problems, complex challenges, and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of this combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities which are highly valued in the globalised world, including critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work independently across disciplines.

This program goes well beyond the design-thinking and design-led innovation programmes now common in university environments to examine how innovation is led from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\nThe management focus of the program provides integrated exposure to the structure, function, and operation of the socio-culturally dynamic entertainment and experience industries, with a special focus on the visitor and audience economies of events, sport business, and the digital creative sector. Featuring a strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, this course provides a compelling combination of conceptual rigour and practical knowledge, which includes opportunities for internships with industry partners and overseas exchange placements with university partners.\nThe creative intelligence focus of the program propels students to \u2018think differently\u2019 and to experience a new form of education. Instead of lectures and tutorials, students do hackathons, think tanks, and hot housing days in a creative lab environment during their winter and summer schools. They take ideas for a walk and trial speculative scenarios \u2013 they undertake thought experiments and engage in carefully-designed sandpit environments with creative methods and practices from across the disciplines.\nIn summary, this combined degree brings together multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating insights from the entertainment and experience industries, this allowing for the cultivation of real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the \u2018wicked\u2019 problems, complex challenges, and untapped opportunities in today's world.\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of this combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities which are highly valued in the globalised world, including critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work independently across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-management-bachelor-creative-intelligence-and-innovation", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"41050\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in the field of study gives students more confidence when they commence as a teacher. Students enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.\nThe unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.\nTo ensure high quality teachers in the education sector, students need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into the final years of the program.\nIf students do not meet this Credit average, they are still able to continue in the Bachelor of Business and graduate with that qualification.\nStudents spend 80 days in one of 200+ Secondary Schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps students gain the skills and confidence in curriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in Business and Economics, and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.\nNot only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they will have the benefits of a range of career options.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-business-master-teaching-secondary-education", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"42800\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.

Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in the field of study gives students more confidence when they commence as a teacher. Students enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.\nThe unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.\nTo ensure high quality teachers in the education sector, students need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into the final years of the program.\nIf students do not meet this Credit average, they are still able to continue in the Bachelor of Business and graduate with that qualification.\nStudents spend 80 days in one of 200+ Secondary Schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps students gain the skills and confidence in curriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in Business and Economics, and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.\nNot only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they will have the benefits of a range of career options.", "url": "https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/bachelor-business-master-teaching-secondary-education", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": "{\"url\": \"https://www.uts.edu.au/study/international/essential-information/apply-uts-international-student\", \"cutOffMark\": \"N/A\", \"tuition\": {\"#text\": \"42800\", \"tuitionText\": {\"table\": {\"tr\": [{\"th\": [{\"a\": \"Course Code\"}, {\"a\": \"Course Name\"}, {\"a\": [\"\", {\"span\": {\"#text\": \"Total CP\", \"span\": \"The total number of credit points required to complete the course.
