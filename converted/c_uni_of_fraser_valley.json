(GDD) provides you with a solid foundation in four fields of professional practice:\u00a0 brand identity, graphic/communication design, dynamic media, and interactive design.\nAs a student, you are immersed in design practice through project-based learning in collaborative Mac studio spaces. You\u2019ll build a strong foundation in design process, resourcefulness, and conceptual development, as well as skills in critical thinking, typography, image making, content creation, and industry standard Adobe software.\nThe Graphic and Digital Design diploma (GDD) is a full-time 60-credit cohort program offered on the Mission campus (fall intake), and the Abbotsford campus (winter intake).\nAs a GDD diploma student, you\u2019ll be part of a cohort that moves together through the entire two-year program. You must register for five courses in each semester and each individual graphic design course is only offered once per academic year on each campus. Courses in the GDD diploma are taught\u00a0by dynamic faculty engaged in design\u00a0practice, professional communities, and academic research.\nExpect at least four hours of homework each week for each course. GDD is both demanding and rewarding, requiring that you put in the time and commitment to build a strong professional practice portfolio.\nView the program outline for the Graphic Design diploma in the UFV Academic Calendar.\nView\u00a02021-22 UFV GDD Program Planner\nExperiential Learning\nIndustry engagement is essential to learning.

The BIS is designed to support students with prior academic and/or professional training and experience who want to attain a credential for professional and educational advancement.\n\n\nThe BIS degree provides the greatest flexibility of any program. The degree is non-disciplinary and allows students to combine courses and short programs (e.g., certificates, minors, themes, etc.). Students can choose courses offered from across UFV to meet degree requirements. Students work with an academic advisor to select courses that best meet their learning goals, schedules, and other needs.\n\n\nThe BIS degree is rigorous. BIS students demonstrate competency in six core areas and complete foundational study in written communications and statistics. BIS students carry out advanced academic coursework in multiple disciplines as well as portfolio and career learning.\n\n\nThe BIS is a transfer-friendly program. Students can transfer up to 90 credits into their degree. UFV also maintains transfer partnerships with multiple public and private educational and training providers.\n\n\nYou can complete your degree more quickly than other options. Many students find that they can complete their degree more quickly in the BIS, because of the degree\u2019s flexibility, use of transfer credit, and non-disciplinary structure.\n\n\nOur graduates succeed! Just over half of BIS alumni pursue graduate study, Teacher Education and other professional programs, and many other graduates obtain professional certification in specialized areas of practice.\n\nWhether you are new to university or are returning to school after some time in the workforce, speak to an academic advisor about how you can complete your Bachelor of Integrated Studies degree.\nSpecializations\nBachelor of Integrated Studies students can combine additional credentials and designations as part of their degree. Options include Themes, Concentrations, Minors, Certificates, and Diplomas.\nThemes\nCreate a unique specialization around a unique theme or concept, using upper-level credits from two or more disciplines. If applicable, you complete the bulk of your theme courses in your last two years. If you are considering a theme, meet with an academic advisor as early in your program as possible, to ensure that you can complete the program in good time. Learn more about theme options.\nConcentration in Applied Management\nGeared for students with experience in staff supervision, management, and business, the Concentration in Applied Management further equips professionals with relevant and essential management training while completing their degree.\nMinors, Extended Minors, and Certificates\nBuild one or more minors or extended minors into your degree from a diversity of fields in the arts, sciences, professional studies, and health. Or choose to complete an associate or full certificate in a specialized area of practice, with options ranging from Agricultural Technology to Workplace Education. For the full range of options, see UFV\u2019s Programs list.\nAviation\nStudents completing or who have completed\u00a0Aviation training can receive academic credit for Transport Canada-issued licenses, and use this credit towards the Bachelor of Integrated Studies.

You explore a variety of fields that may be of interest before choosing to specialize in exercise science, pedagogy, or active health.\nIn your third and fourth year, you develop skills for teaching and counselling athletes, and learn about athletic injuries, research methods, applied ethics, physiology, exercise testing, and exercise prescription. You also select a specialty out of the following specializations:\n\nThe Exercise Science\u00a0specialization prepares you for a career as a kinesiologist or exercise physiologist, graduate school, and/or professional school (such as physiotherapy, medicine or chiropractic).\nThe Pedagogy\u00a0specialization prepares you for continued certification in teacher education,\u00a0coaching, sport performance advising, and/or graduate school.\nThe Active Health specialization prepares you for a career in health and wellness, specifically community health and fitness, athletic therapy, sports psychology, and fitness management and recreation, and those planning to continue onto graduate school.\n\nTo compare the three specializations and view the course requirements, please see the kinesiology program outline in the Academic Calendar.\nKinesiology Minor\nIf you are pursuing a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, or Bachelor of General Studies, you can opt to complete a minor in Kinesiology to learn about human anatomy and movement.\nLearn the various influences that affect human physical performance whether that be emotional, behavioural, cognitive or the physiological systems within our bodies. Acquire counselling skills used by instructors and consultants in the fitness industry, and find out how and when to apply them.\nPlease note that the program outline for the Kinesiology minor for Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of General Studies students is slightly different than the Kinesiology minor for Bachelor of Science students.\nAdditional features\nMinors and extended minors\nPair your Bachelor of Kinesiology with any of the existing minors (including Arts, Science and Business) or extended minors offered at UFV (with the exception of the Biology extended minor).\nLearn more about\u00a0pairing your Bachelor of Kinesiology with a minor or extended minor\u00a0in the UFV Academic Calendar.\nBiology minor\nCombine your Bachelor of Kinesiology degree with a minor in Biology especially tailored for Kinesiology students.
