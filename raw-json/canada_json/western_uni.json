You'll experience our flora and fauna as interconnected global ecosystems through sophisticated experimental design and data analysis. And you'll also have the opportunity to get your hands dirty with a field research project in a biodiverse location like the Adirondacks, Costa Rica, or Ecuador.\nAfter you graduate, the world is yours - you can go on to graduate school, get a medical or law degree, or join an industry or government team focused on lab quality assurance, research, policy and more.",

It‚Äôs about using tools to analyze language function, but also exploring the historical and social variations in language.\nWords are powerful and complex. From phonetics and phonology to syntax and semantics. If you don‚Äôt know these yet, you‚Äôll be an expert when you graduate.\nUnderstanding every aspect of language is helpful for almost every profession. You might gravitate towards teaching, translation, and speech pathology. But technology is creating a new need for experts in linguistics. Think artificial intelligence and language/voice recognition programs. Linguistics will always be in-demand.",

And we don‚Äôt shy away from controversial topics.\n\nIs an inclusive feminism possible?\nHow does the law affect women?\nHow did homophobia aid the Cold War?\nHow are women represented in pop culture?\nShould we be teaching people how to have sex or how not to have sex?\nHow do surveillance technologies aim to track, identify, and classify gender, race and sexuality?\nIs there such a thing as queer time?\n\nThat‚Äôs a lot to unpack. But when you finish, you‚Äôll be a socially conscious citizen ready to make a difference in the world. With the skills you‚Äôll work on in writing and critical thinking, you‚Äôll be ready for careers in law, journalism, social work and more.",

Will humans become cyborgs‚Äîor obsolete?\nAre there universal ethical principles that can guide the conduct of multinational corporations?\nHow do biases manifest in scientific production? Does the gender of the knower make a difference?\n\n\nYour courses in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, and logic, as well as more specialized courses in philosophy of science, feminism, philosophy of mind and language, and applied ethics will develop and hone your skills as a reader, writer, analyst, and thinker.",

How and why do they change? What is the intention (policy) behind a rule? What does the data say about the consequences of a given policy? What do we know about political persuasion? Is a given change a positive trend or not?\nWe love these questions, and all their detailed variations. Study with us and you gain the skills essential to any profession, from analyzing data to communicating persuasively.
