The interdisciplinary nature of the program also ensures you get skills in field work, lab work and the process of conducting scientific research.\nThe core of the Integrated Science program is composed of Integrated Science I and II, which are equivalent to two terms of Biology and Psychology and one term of Earth Sciences and Statistics. Along with Ethics in Science, students will fulfill the writing requirements for BSc students. Students will also register for co-requisite courses in Chemistry and Calculus which are taken alongside other BSc students.\nIntegrated Science students learn on and off campus through group work, hands-on field trips, lab experiments and computer-based exercises. Most students who enroll in Integrated Science in their first year at Dalhousie also end up completing an honours degree in science. \u00a0\nSample courses:\n\nIntegrated Science I\nIntegrated Science II\nEthics in Science\n\u00a0\n\nVisit the Academic Calendar to view degree options and course details.", "url": "https://www.dal.ca/academics/programs/undergraduate/disp.html", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"url": "https://www.dal.ca/admissions/international-students/admission-requirements/requirements-by-country.html", "cutOffMark": "N/A", "tuition": {"#text": "31900", "tuitionText": "N/A", "tuitionURL": "https://www.dal.ca/admissions/money_matters/tuition_payments/fee_calculator.html"}, "applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A", "additonalRequirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"url": "https://www.dal.ca/admissions/international-students/admission-requirements/requirements-by-country.html", "cutOffMark": "N/A", "tuition": {"#text": "31900", "tuitionText": "N/A", "tuitionURL": "https://www.dal.ca/admissions/money_matters/tuition_payments/fee_calculator.html"}, "applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A", "additonalRequirements": "N/A"}, "importantTag": "science"}, {"university_name": "Dalhousie University", "acronym": "DalHousie", "world_ranking": 314, "address": "6299 South St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada", "province": "NS", "country_code": "CA", "geotag": ["east", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/FJSeP5KUAcyw4bVD7", "admission_email": "admissions@dal.ca", "phone_number": "+1 902-494-2211", "website_url": "https://www.dal.ca/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://www.dal.ca/admissions/international-students/admission-requirements/english-requirements.html\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"Overall: 6.5, Bands: 6.0\"}, {\"testName\": \"TOEFL\", \"testMinScore\": \"Overall: 90, Bands: 20\"}, {\"testName\": \"Duolingo\", \"testMinScore\": \"Overall: 115, Subscores: 95\"}, {\"testName\": \"Michigan English Test (formerly MELAB)\", \"testMinScore\": 55}, {\"testName\": \"CAEL\", \"testMinScore\": 70}, {\"testName\": \"Pearson Test of English - Academic\", \"testMinScore\": \"Overall: 61, Communicative skills scores: 50\"}, {\"testName\": \"C1: Advanced / C2: Proficiency\", \"testMinScore\": \"Overall: 180\"}]}}", "course_name": "Contemporary Studies", "faculty": "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences", "program_length": "N/A", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "Today's world is diverse and complex and our assumptions about it are constantly challenged.
