Students must complete at least three years of post-secondary experience prior to admission to this program.\nThe program is designed to involve medical students with a broad range of human health problems and with early exposure to patients. There are also opportunities for students to gain education and experience in more remote Northern Canadian areas or in an international setting. The program is three years in length and runs for 11 months of the year. In recent years, enrolment has increased to 203 places with the addition of the Waterloo Regional and the Niagara Regional campuses.\nThe School of Medicine, established in 1965 and renamed the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine in 2004, offers major programs in undergraduate, postgraduate and graduate medical education. The clinical programs use not only the teaching hospitals and ambulatory care and research facilities at the McMaster University Medical Centre division of Hamilton Health Sciences, but also the clinical teaching units at several of the major Hamilton hospitals and community health-care centres.\nThe Undergraduate Medical Program for the MD degree was initiated in 1969, graduating its first students in May 1972. At present, 203 students are admitted to the program each year.",

The program is taught using inquiry and problem-based learning models which enhance each student’s ability to think critically, solve problems, demonstrate initiative and independence in practice and promote lifelong learning. Physician Assistants (PAs) are health care professionals who work with physicians to provide health care. Under the overall supervision of a physician, PAs take histories, conduct physical exams, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret tests, counsel on preventive health care and may assist in surgery. A PA’s practice may also include education, research and administration.",

By covering foundational topics earlier on, you’ll have space to take specialized elective courses in or outside of your field in upper years.",

            "introduction": "Midwives are primary health care providers who care for and advise women during pregnancy, labour, birth and the postpartum period; and provide care for newborn babies. Midwives have well-developed interpersonal skills and are competent in areas of health education, counselling and interprofessional collaboration. Midwives’ expertise in the care of normal pregnancy and childbirth arises from their understanding of childbearing as a social, cultural and biological process and from their ability to competently exercise clinical skills and decision-making. Midwifery is potentially one of the most important components of women’s health care in Ontario. Midwifery education provides the base for sound professional practice. The educational program is an integral part of the evolution of the profession of midwifery in Ontario and is a leader in midwifery education in Canada. The program helps create future leaders and teachers. It assures practice and teaching as a continuum so that learning environments become available across Ontario.\nThe Midwifery Education Program at McMaster University is a collaborative venture shared by McMaster, Ryerson and leads to a Bachelor of Health Sciences (B.H.Sc.) in Midwifery.\n* 75% minimum average required for consideration plus interview. Admission is by selection. Students must obtain a minimum grade of 75% in English, Biology and Chemistry. Additionally, students must achieve an overall minimum consideration average of 75%",

Statisticians examine the patterns which arise in data with the goal of distinguishing true patterns from chance effects.\nThe Mathematics and Statistics I program introduces students to the foundational tools and ideas of mathematics leading into our degree programs.",

Both institutions are acknowledged leaders in health sciences education in Ontario, with a record of success in program collaboration and pedagogical innovation.\nMRSc program graduates are healthcare professionals who employ different kinds of radiation in diagnostic and therapy and are part of one of the fastest growing health care fields. Students in this program pursue two concurrent qualifications: an Ontario College Advanced Diploma in Medical Radiation Sciences from Mohawk College and the McMaster University Bachelor of Medical Radiation Sciences degree. The model was designed to enable students to simultaneously achieve two academic credentials.\nMRSc involves the use of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation for diagnostic studies and the treatment of patients. Ionizing radiation includes x-rays and gamma rays; non-ionizing radiation includes magnetic fields and ultrasound. The collaboration between McMaster University and Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology gives students in the Medical Radiation Sciences program the best of both worlds.",

Social scientists at McMaster come from a variety of backgrounds. They share a curiosity about individuals and society and use a number of approaches and research methods to advance our understanding of individuals, groups and social relationships and activities.\nStudy in the Social Sciences at McMaster will help you to engage with some of the most compelling questions in contemporary society: How did we get here? Where should we be going? How should we organize our economy? How do different institutions in society shape our experiences? How might we achieve a just society? Studying the Social Sciences will stimulate your curiosity, encourage you to seek the answers to important questions and develop the skills you need to engage the world around you.",
