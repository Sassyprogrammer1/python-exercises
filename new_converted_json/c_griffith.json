You'll also learn about advanced theoretical concepts and policy debates in contemporary criminology - setting you up to access a career at more than an entry-level position in the criminal justice system.  Your research will help to identify the social issues that lead to crime. You'll also learn to understand what makes criminals tick as well as how to minimise the negative impacts of crime on society.  Industry and expert connections At Griffith, criminology has always had a strong industry connection and a high level of cooperation from police agencies and other crime related bodies. This Honours degree continues the tradition with a multitude of opportunities to meet with and hear from industry experts.

The degree is built around a tailored employability framework, so you'll have the tools and experience to start building a successful and meaningful social science career well before you graduate. * Times Higher Education World Rankings 2021 You\u2019ll study some of society\u2019s most intriguing issues along with the techniques to analyse them and devise break-through solutions. You\u2019ll be equipped to combine your hard knowledge of world issues with advanced data analysis techniques. You\u2019ll develop the knowledge to select the appropriate tools and methodologies for the issues you\u2019re working on, along with the communication skills to collate and present your findings to decision-makers, to enable evidence-based solutions that can positively transform society. Climate change is an example of a contemporary challenge that can\u2019t be solved by 'pure' science alone. Solutions will come from people who can not only interpret the data but also understand the need for social impact studies, policy development, and effective public communication. Social scientists work in these intersecting spaces, which is why they are in high-demand across government departments, creative industries, political parties, the business sector, in think tanks and non-government organisations (NGOs). You don\u2019t need prior knowledge of statistical research methods as you\u2019ll study core courses that will develop your skills in analysing social policy and data, along with your two majors. Each of the majors represents a different perspective on the challenges of the future and allow you to develop areas of expertise that can open doors to a broad range of careers. There are also opportunities to undertake an internship in an area of your interest and join a global study tour. Majors You can choose two of the following majors:   Economics  Environmental Sustainability Global Security Threats Media, Communication and Social Change  Politics in Asia Social Justice   Economics: If you want an expert insight into why the Australian dollar fluctuates or what caused the Global Financial Crisis, this major is the ideal choice. You\u2019ll gain an understanding of the big financial issues facing societies and learn how governments make decisions about what to spend on complex issues such as the environment, healthcare, infrastructure and resources. You\u2019ll also learn how markets work, and how businesses make decisions about pricing, staffing and responding to competition. Environmental Sustainability: Environmental sustainability is the world\u2019s biggest issue. This major is not about the \u2018hard science\u2019 of the environment but instead explores the key social and policy issues behind the need for sustainable management of our planet\u2019s finite resources. In this major you\u2019ll study environmental politics, climate change policy, the economics of natural resources, and environmental ethics and culture. Global Security Threats: If you\u2019re interested in developing future-focused solutions to some of the world\u2019s most complex challenges, this major is for you. You\u2019ll be exposed to a stimulating array of international issues, including conflict and forced displacement, terrorism and political violence, Islam-West relations, cybercrime, energy security, and the environment. You'll gain a critical understanding of underlying causes, underpinned by a foundational course in World History. Media, Communication and Social Change: In the information age, the ways we communicate - and are communicated to - are diverse and ever changing. The ability to understand and manipulate communications is crucial to creating change. Producing, interpreting and analysing communications are not only desirable skills, but fascinating areas of study. This major covers such topics as, the power of mass and social media, journalism, public relations, discourse analysis, new communication technologies, political spin, and the global spread of English. Politics in Asia: This major harnesses Griffith\u2019s internationally recognised strengths in politics and Asian studies. You\u2019ll develop a deep understanding of the political, cultural, economic and social dimensions of the Asian region. Topics include the rise of China, global security, the interconnection of business and politics, the role of international organisations, and Australia\u2019s place in the region. Social Justice: This major is for those who are motivated by the fundamental question, \u2018What makes a fair society?\u2019 and are passionate about fighting for a better world. Social justice refers to the idea that all people deserve equal and fair opportunities and treatment. By specialising in this area, you\u2019ll explore contemporary hot topics such as human rights, indigenous history and disadvantage, gender and crime, domestic violence, youth justice, power and politics and the administration of the law.| Social science applies the 'science' of research and analysis to the world\u2019s complex 'social' problems such as sustainability, equity, and diversity, to create positive change.
