The Bridge to BScN degree provides practising RPNs with the greater depth of foundational knowledge required to care for increasingly complex clients within the scope of practice of an entry level RN. The program prepares graduates to write the NCLEX-RN entry to practice exam.\nGraduates of a two-year Practical Nursing diploma from an Ontario college who successfully complete the bridging courses during the first two semesters of this program may enter Semester 5 (Year 3) of the BScN degree. A final grade of 65% or higher is required in each bridge course.\nStudents may complete the two-semester Bridge plus Year 3 and 4 of the BScN degree in six consecutive semesters. This fast track completion will help you achieve your educational goals sooner.\nAs a working registered practical nurse pursuing this program, you will benefit from the flexibility of bridging theory courses offered primarily online and clinical placements focused on meeting the entry to practice competencies for Registered Nurses.",

The proposed program will offer the flexibility to work with both types of registered practitioners (occupational therapists and physiotherapists).\nOntario\u2019s aging population has seen a growing need for support from occupational therapists, physiotherapists and their assistants to maintain their physical health, recover from surgeries and manage the functional limitations associated with a range of chronic conditions.\nUnique to Seneca\u2019s approach, in the first semester of the program you\u2019ll learn two-eyed seeing; a theoretical concept of seeing the world through both Indigenous and Western perspectives.\nThe program delivery model will explore a mix of delivery modes that include an in-person hands on component as well as online, hybrid and flex classes. You\u2019ll gain practical experience in our brand-new on-campus simulation lab and through a robust 500+ hour clinical placement experience. This allows you to apply in-class learning to a workplace, while building a professional network and ensuring you are career-ready upon graduation.\nThis program is currently pending ministry approval with its first start planned for September 2024.",
