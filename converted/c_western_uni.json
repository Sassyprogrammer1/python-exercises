didn\u2019t expect Science to come up in Arts  Humanities. But it\u2019s a big part of linguistics: the scientific and humanistic study of language. It\u2019s about using tools to analyze language function, but also exploring the historical and social variations in language.\nWords are powerful and complex. From phonetics and phonology to syntax and semantics. If you don\u2019t know these yet, you\u2019ll be an expert when you graduate.\nUnderstanding every aspect of language is helpful for almost every profession. You might gravitate towards teaching, translation, and speech pathology. But technology is creating a new need for experts in linguistics. Think artificial intelligence and language/voice recognition programs.
