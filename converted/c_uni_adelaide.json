our direct-entry Bachelor of Science (Advanced)(Honours) is ideal if you haven\u2019t yet chosen an area of science to specialise in, but\u2014once you have\u2014want to follow that path well beyond step one.\nThe program again builds on our Bachelor of Science (Advanced)\u00a0and lets you explore your scientific curiosity before specialising. But at every stage, you\u2019ll be challenged by even greater academic demands. Ultimately, you\u2019ll emerge as a clear future leader in your field.\nWhat will you do?\nYour first year is all about discovery. You\u2019ll investigate a number of scientific fields, before choosing a major to focus on in years two and three (see Bachelor of Science (Advanced) for choices).\nDuring this time you\u2019ll enjoy the same fantastic opportunities offered to all Bachelor of Science (Advanced) students. That includes developing advanced research skills, making real-world connections through internships, and potentially gaining global experience with international study. In your honours year, you\u2019ll then advance along either a disciplinary research or professional skills pathway.\nThe disciplinary research path is the most research-intensive. Working with a specific researcher or research group, you\u2019ll undertake a major research project, together with advanced coursework, in one of the following study areas:\nThe less research-intensive professional skills path will expand your scientific knowledge and skills more broadly. You\u2019ll undertake a major industry or community-related project, along with advanced general coursework, in your choice of:\nSearch for an honours project\nWhere could it take you?\nDepending on your study choices, you could emerge well-prepared for senior and leadership roles in a specific scientific discipline or as a science generalist, in the public or private sector. Or perhaps you\u2019ll aim higher still and go on to master\u2019s-level research. Wherever you want to go, you\u2019ll be perfectly placed.\nDirect access to industry leaders and paid internship opportunities: The Academy by DeloitteThis degree gives you the opportunity to be part of our new The Academy by Deloitte You\u2019ll be part of a supportive student cohort that learns from one another and industry leaders. Formal and informal experiences will allow you to build relationships within the Deloitte network.\n^QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2022 *Good Universities Guide, 2021", "url":

Animals and plants are dying out, oceans are overfished and polluted, loggers cut down precious forests, and climate change is affecting the planet. Finding a way to live together and protect the environment could be our greatest challenge.\nEnvironmental policy, applied effectively, can stop this from happening through land and water management, carbon mitigation and adaptation, national parks, and new approaches to sustainable development. Environmental policy makers solve problems with the community and protect the environment for a better future. They protect vital ecosystems and stand between the environment and processes that degrade it.\nWhat will you do?\nOur Bachelor of Environmental Policy and Management challenges you to make a positive impact. You will:\nThere are also travel opportunities. We offer exchanges and study tours where you\u2019ll tackle real-life problems in vulnerable communities.\nWhere could it take you?\nEnvironmental expertise is in demand. You could spend your days outdoors managing landscapes, engaging with communities, or drawing up plans for business and government. You might set up programs to restore habitats for local wildlife. Perhaps you\u2019ll work towards sustainability in rangelands or urban communities, build policy around renewable energy, or get involved with ecotourism.Direct access to industry leaders and paid internship opportunities: The Academy by DeloitteThis degree gives you the opportunity to be part of our new The Academy by Deloitte.
