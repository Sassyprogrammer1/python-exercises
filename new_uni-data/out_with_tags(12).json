Studying a subject that excites you will help you do well academically.You can pick nearly any major. You'll need to complete at least three years of undergraduate studies, although many law schools prefer that you complete your undergraduate degree (four years) before applying.Most of Waterloo's programs can be excellent preparation for law school. There are some programs that are especially popular because of the communications and analytical skills they provide as background to becoming a successful lawyer.",

These programs can take as little as 20 months to finish instead of the four years of a regular nursing degree.If you're interested in careers in areas such as medicine, nursing, optometry, physiotherapy, or pharmacy, several Waterloo programs are great preparation.Lauryanne Bolland comes from a family of nurses, but it was her Waterloo co-op experiences working alongside various healthcare professionals that solidified the idea to pursue a career in nursing.After graduating from Waterloo's Kinesiology program, Lauryanne completed an accelerated nursing program at Queen\u2019s University. (An accelerated nursing program takes less time to complete because students already have completed at least two years of university studies).Lauryanne works at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in Toronto on the surgical oncology floor, where she helps head and neck, urology, and general surgery patients.",

In your final year, you\u2019ll complete a thesis, an independent study, or a community engagement placement.A Bachelor of Public Health degree will equip you to make important contributions to society, whether it\u2019s researching ways to control infectious diseases such as COVID-19, developing healthy eating campaigns for teenagers, or improving social services for seniors in your community.",

Later, he participated in excavating the ancestral sites of Indigenous groups in southern Ontario after graduating from Anthropology at Waterloo.In a rapidly changing and increasingly globalized world, the insights of anthropology are more valuable than ever.In Anthropology at Waterloo, you\u2019ll explore cultures past and present. Delve into the origins of human and primate evolution, use archaeology to learn more about earlier societies, or tackle contemporary issues such as violence and media.Our first-year introductory anthropology course exposes you to the breadth of this discipline. In your upper years, you can focus your degree on the area of anthropology that interests you most: socio-cultural, archaeological, or biological (physical) anthropology.You\u2019ll graduate to a wide range of career options, including market research, cultural resource management, forensic anthropology, and international development, with the added bonus of work experience if you take the co-op stream.",

Build your program around your interests, studying topics from technology and software to life and health sciences, environmental issues, and policy making. If you\u2019re a high-achieving student and want the freedom to integrate a broad range of interests, this is your program.What you do with your degree is up to you.

All of these revelations happened because dedicated scientists looked at the world a little differently.At Waterloo, you\u2019ll dive into your Biology major right from day one. And with more than 80 biology courses available, you\u2019ve got plenty of options. From microbes and genes to plants and zoology, we've got something for anyone who's passionate about living systems.You\u2019ll graduate ready for a career in laboratory or field research, environmental assessment, education, health professions, or industry. If you enrol in co-op, you'll also have up to two years of paid work experience to add to your resume.",

And have the opportunity to apply it all in your co-op work terms, too.Once you graduate, you\u2019ll have a wide range of options. A philosophy degree is ideal for a career in law and valuable preparation for just about any field that demands breadth of thinking, careful reading, thorough analysis, and clear argumentation.",

Examine how the body ages, how disease and injury impact it, and what diagnostic tools can identify physiological problems.You\u2019ll start with foundational courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and math that prepare you to meet the admission requirements of most health-related professional schools. After first year, you\u2019ll focus on human biology with courses in anatomy, physiology, histology, microbiology, and biochemistry. Add some complementary courses from science and related disciplines and then round out your degree with electives of your choice.By the time you graduate, you\u2019ll have the solid scientific foundation you need to succeed in most health care professions or to pursue specialized Master's or PhD degrees.",

In Earth Sciences you'll learn about the make up of our planet, from rocks and soil to water and the effects of climate change. We depend upon resources that come from the Earth, such as minerals, oil, organic materials, gases, and the water we drink. Who finds these hidden and valuable resources? A geoscientist!Dig deep with your choice of specialization: Geology, Geophysics, or Hydrogeology. And if you're up for it, apply your knowledge through the paid work experiences co-op offers.When you graduate, you\u2019ll be eligible for a Professional Geoscientist designation \u2014 and be ready to develop meaningful environmental protection plans, predict natural disasters, advance health standards for water, and more.",

How do organisms adjust to changes in their environment and how can our knowledge of the chemistry of life be applied to improving the human condition? To answer these questions, we study the structures of molecules \u2013\u00a0such as enzymes \u2013\u00a0and the diverse metabolic processes \u2013\u00a0such as the Krebs cycle\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that are fundamental to life.In Biochemistry, you'll create chemicals. Analyze genes. Explore the fundamentals of metabolism. You\u2019ll start with a broad science foundation in first year, including chemistry, biology, physics, and calculus.You\u2019ll graduate with the knowledge and skills to work in a wide range of areas, from forensics to pharmaceuticals to food and agriculture.",

And thanks to small classes, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity to connect with other students and professors.Materials and Nanoscience is a mix of chemistry, physics, and math. You\u2019ll also take materials science courses where you learn about what makes a substance unique. For example, if you arrange atoms in a certain way, why does the material have stability and strength rather than flexibility? In upper years, you can choose to take more chemistry or physics. It all depends on what aspects of materials science you enjoy.",

Explore your curiosity with a Physics and Astronomy degree from Waterloo.Complement your foundational studies in physics and math with courses in astronomy. Interested in research? Waterloo's Centre for Astrophysics hosts aspiring young researchers and students, helping them to unlock the mysteries of the universe. Researchers will collaborate with some of the top astrophysics agencies in the world.The program\u2019s strong ties to Waterloo\u2019s Institute for Quantum Computing provide additional opportunities to get involved in research. Meanwhile, if you opt for our co-op program, you\u2019ll gain valuable r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building experience on your work terms.Join a program that fosters curious minds to question the smallest particles, the largest forces, and everything in between. Where you'll get the support you need to succeed (and maybe win a Nobel Prize like Waterloo professor\u00a0Donna Strickland or be part of a team to take the first image of a black hole, like professor\u00a0Avery Broderick).Once you complete your degree, you\u2019ll have what it takes to pursue specialized graduate programs or to launch directly into a career in fields like aerospace, astrophysics, or remote sensing.",

Ensure the safety of dams and pipelines, assess risks for landslides and earthquakes, remove hazardous waste from groundwater, and more.Waterloo\u2019s program is one of only two in Ontario. You\u2019ll take Civil Engineering classes where you\u2019ll learn design and problem-solving skills. You\u2019ll also take Earth Sciences classes to acquire a solid background in geosciences. Meanwhile, through co-op, you'll gain two years of related work experience.Don\u2019t want to be stuck at a desk all day? You\u2019ll have the opportunity to examine geological processes first-hand through field courses.When you graduate, your degree can take you around the world \u2014 working in natural resource and mineral exploration, hazard waste removal, groundwater management, infrastructure planning, and more.",
