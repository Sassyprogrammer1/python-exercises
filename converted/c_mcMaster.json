Students must complete at least three years of post-secondary experience prior to admission to this program.\nThe program is designed to involve medical students with a broad range of human health problems and with early exposure to patients. There are also opportunities for students to gain education and experience in more remote Northern Canadian areas or in an international setting. The program is three years in length and runs for 11 months of the year. In recent years, enrolment has increased to 203 places with the addition of the Waterloo Regional and the Niagara Regional campuses.\nThe School of Medicine, established in 1965 and renamed the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine in 2004, offers major programs in undergraduate, postgraduate and graduate medical education. The clinical programs use not only the teaching hospitals and ambulatory care and research facilities at the McMaster University Medical Centre division of Hamilton Health Sciences, but also the clinical teaching units at several of the major Hamilton hospitals and community health-care centres.\nThe Undergraduate Medical Program for the MD degree was initiated in 1969, graduating its first students in May 1972.
