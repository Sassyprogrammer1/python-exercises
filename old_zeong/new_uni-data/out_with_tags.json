There is a growing need for engineers with expertise in the closely related areas of heritage conservation and sustainable building design. Carleton\u2019s program in Architectural Conservation and Sustainability Engineering teaches students a modern approach for the design and retrofit of buildings that holds sustainability as the guiding objective while respecting architectural history and significance. Students learn to consider the life cycle costs and environmental impacts of building materials, energy demand, and the effective reuse and conservation of existing structures. Students in the program work closely with Carleton\u2019s architecture students.",

Understanding the costs and benefits of development and conservation, as well as the underlying values and ethical guidelines for good environmental practice are critical for informed environmental decision-making.

In our Geomatics BSc program, you will obtain intensive science-based training in geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing (imaging from satellites and aircraft) and cartography, including web-based applications. You will apply advanced computer software and techniques to the challenge of understanding the Earth\u2019s physical and natural systems, addressing environmental problems and planning human interventions. Our program combines hands-on learning, using the latest in laboratory facilities, with opportunities to gain field experience and do work placements. Science based geomatics applications include the modeling and mapping of the physical and natural environment, resource planning, land cover and vegetation mapping, and hazards mapping, amongst many others. The BSc in Geomatics includes training in associated physical or natural sciences and computer sciences.",

Carleton\u2019s Civil Engineering program starts by giving students a thorough background in mathematics, chemistry, physics, thermodynamics, geology and numerical methods. In the final two years, students focus on engineering design in the areas of structural, geotechnical, transportation and municipal engineering. Elective courses allow students to further specialize in the area of their choice. The program culminates in a practical fourth-year design project where the students apply their knowledge to a real-world design problem.",

The program examines the literature, language, history, philosophy, mythology, religion, social and economic life, technology, art, architecture and archaeology of the ancient world, framed by the impact on the Mediterranean basin of the city-states of Greece and the Roman Republic and Empire. In addition to learning about the history of civilizations that have made an indelible impact on the modern world, you will have the opportunity to learn the ancient Greek and Latin languages, to study ancient literature in the original languages or in translation, and to benefit from the expertise of Carleton scholars who have a rich variety of interests and areas of specialty. The program is intrinsically interdisciplinary: the study of Classics provides a well-rounded education, producing graduates who can reason, argue, and communicate\u2014essential skills for any field. A minor in Archaeology is also available.",

This program combines computer programming, and signal and image processing courses with foundational courses in physics, math, project management and business. While also acquiring a strong IT background, students will learn about digital signal processing, optical communication networks, lasers, manufacturing and advanced optical component design through our specialized hands-on laboratories. Upper year courses include advanced subjects such as computer vision, remote sensing (especially LIDAR), and biomedical imaging and biosensors. Our program has very strong ties with industry and we make every effort to ensure that the\u00a0program remains up to date with current trends through an industrial advisory board (in the IT, Laser, Optics and Photonics fields). Students that possess both IT skills and a fundamental understanding of optical technologies are in extremely high demand in today\u2019s local industries.",

Physics is also the scaffolding behind the technology found in numerous current advances such as in smart phones, self-driving cars and radiation treatment of cancer. Physicists are keen to understand the nature of the world around them, as well as to control it for the betterment of humanity. They use their creativity to solve challenging problems, whether they are creating very powerful lasers for eye surgery, colliding particles at very-high energy, or descending deep down into underground mines to investigate the most basic building blocks of matter. Physicists look for and examine patterns in nature in order to formulate natural laws. They push scientific boundaries by exploring unknown territory through theory and experimentation, often thinking about and describing our physical world in ways that we cannot yet observe in nature.",

Truly sustainable development, however, will require the clever integration of renewable energy technologies into existing infrastructure, along with vastly improved efficiencies in non-renewable energy use. This program provides analytical and hands-on skills for designing, building, operating and enhancing sustainable energy systems that combine energy generation, distribution and utilization in an environmentally responsible and economically beneficial manner. Two streams are offered: Smart Technologies for Power Generation and Distribution, and Efficient Energy Generation and Conversion.",
