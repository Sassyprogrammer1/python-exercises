program study a combination of Criminology and Law courses over a period of five years (full-time). In the first three years students complete all the courses required for the Bachelor of Criminology degree, which includes eight core Law courses. In the final two years students study all remaining core and directed Law courses to complete the requirements of the accredited Bachelor of Laws (Honours) degree, which meets the academic requirements to practise law in NSW.\nAfter completing the Bachelor of Criminology, students are automatically enrolled into the Bachelor of Laws (Honours)/Diploma of Legal Practice Program in the fourth and fifth years of study. Students in the accredited Diploma of Legal Practice complete legal practice modules and practical legal training by working on real life cases at the University of Newcastle Legal Centre, and in external placements with law firms, legal professionals and in government departments and agencies.\nStudents who complete the combined Bachelor of Laws (Honours)/Diploma of Legal Practice program are eligible to seek admission to legal practice without any additional study or practical legal training or workplace experience. Students can opt not to complete the Diploma of Legal Practice, but will need to undertake their professional legal training through another approved provider if they want to be admitted to legal practice.\nOur combined Bachelor of Criminology/Bachelor of Laws (Honours) graduates can analyse and explain crime and criminality from multiple disciplinary perspectives, and use high level problem solving and communication skills to act as advocates in the criminal justice system. Having completed placements and work-integrated learning in diverse contexts, they are work ready and equipped to advocate for a range of stakeholders, and to address legal and social issues that shape the administration of justice in criminal law and related institutions.\nDomestic students who commence full time in Semester 2 should expect to complete the program in a minimum of 5.5 years.",

Mechanical engineers design, manufacture and optimise specialist machines and processes.\u00a0As part of your Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (Honours) you will study how to solve important problems.\u00a0Your core courses in mechanical engineering will teach you to develop solutions\u00a0using robotics, new advanced materials, the fundamental laws of energy generation and transmission, and the computer control of physical systems - from nano to mega-tonne scale. Mechanical Engineering is at the heart of many aeronautical, motorsport  manufacturing teams, with mechanical engineers involved in everything from wind turbines to air conditioners, aircraft and racecars.\nMechanical engineers are valued for their problem-solving ability and generalist knowledge across the different engineering disciplines and are often employed in\u00a0\u00a0discipline-agnostic roles as project managers, designers or advisors.
