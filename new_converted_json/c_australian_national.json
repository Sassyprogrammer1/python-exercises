This highly selective program provides a challenging course of study for students who have a strong interest in and aptitude for graduate research work.Students are expected to acquire a strong foundation in critical analysis and depth in the principles of each subject. They are closely involved in undergraduate research with at least 25 per cent of their graduation requirements based upon independent research.This is a four-year, Honours only, research-based degree. You will spend three semesters in residence at your host university and will write your Honours thesis at your home university. If your institution of primary enrolment is the NUS, you spend the first three semesters there, your next three semesters at ANU and your final two semesters back at NUS.If you are primarily enrolled at ANU, you will spend the first two semesters at ANU, the next three semesters at the NUS and the last three semesters at ANU.The course of study in each major is indicated in the tables below. There is significant flexibility and you can tailor your program of study in consultation with an assigned academic mentor at your home institution, with approval from the relevant coordinator in both universities.Admission to this program is based on meeting the minimum selection rank requirement, submission of the Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) supplementary form and the receipt of two referee reports in support of your application.
