On the other hand, the Minor in Acadian Studies aims to link in a common thematic different courses offered in English which propose a reflection on the Acadian as part of a cultural and linguistic minority.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

Foundational science courses (e.g., General Chemistry) and senior analytical environmental science courses (e.g., Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, Marine Biology) complement the strong field training acquired during the college diploma program. Students graduating from an accredited NAWTA college program with a minimum of a 70% average are eligible to apply to UPEI for formal entry into the Bachelor of Wildlife Conservation degree program.\nOur faculty hold grants from the Natural Sciences and Research Council of Canada, Canada Foundation for Innovation, among others and have research programs in arctic insect ecology, watershed ecology, pollination biology, coastal habitat ecology, animal habitat fragmentation, aquatic toxicology, plant ecological genetics, among others.\nEntry to the program is restricted to September of each year and applications must be received by June 1. Once accepted to UPEI, students will undertake a rigorous program of 20 courses, 15 of which will be required, with an additional 5 courses to be chosen from a list of acceptable electives. Students who are accepted to the program must be able to demonstrate that they have already been vaccinated for Rabies, or obtain a Rabies vaccination during the first year of their program. Students are subject to all of the Academic Regulations of the University.",

            "introduction": "Fine Arts (art history) is a discipline which examines the role of the visual arts in the development of human society. Fine Arts attempts to understand the nature of art, its origins and evolution, and the role it plays in various civilizations. While the task of the artist is the creation of works of art, that of the art historian is their systematic study, analyzing and understanding the products of creative expression. Studies of the Fine Arts can involve the examination of economic, social, and political issues; problems of patronage, taste, style, and iconography; and questions of literary influence, philology, philosophy, psychology, and religion. At the same time, how works of art are made, their conservation and/or restoration and theories of perception or optics are also investigated.\nThe study of Fine Arts helps to enhance our aesthetic aware- ness and our ability to “see” and describe and to search for new meanings and explore new ideas in our environment. The Department of Fine Arts offers a range of art history courses, especially Western art, from ancient times to the present. The art history courses concentrate on the study of architecture, sculpture, painting, and minor/decorative arts. The studio arts course offered by the Department (FAS 1110) provides an introduction to basic artistic techniques.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

A Minor in Indigenous Studies offers students the ability to complement the learnings of their major degree.\nThe carefully selected set of core courses and elective Indigenous courses provide the student knowledge that can be beneficial for future graduate studies or for integration into their careers going forward. Mi’kmaq culture and knowledge feature in a number of courses respecting whose land we are privileged to share knowledge on. All courses are taught by Indigenous instructors.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

Students acquire technical training and practical experience in Journalism (primarily during study at Holland College) and also acquire breadth of knowledge, content exposure, and skills in research, problem-solving, and critical thinking associated with a liberal arts education (primarily during study at UPEI). \nStudents normally undertake one year of study at the University, then complete the two-year Journalism program at Holland College (earning a Holland College diploma), before undertaking a final year of study at the University. The final year of study normally includes an opportunity for journalistic writing either at the University or arranged through Holland College. Deviations from the normal sequence of study between the University and Holland College are permitted. In such cases, at least five courses (15 semester-hours) of study must be completed after the Holland College diploma is earned.",

In the areas of physiology and health, physics and physical methods are applied to understand the production, operation and safe use of ionizing radiation, microwave, radioactive, optical and acoustic sources, and their interactions with living tissues.\nDelivery of high-quality healthcare requires a large pool of highly-trained individuals who will function in a variety of health-related settings such as hospitals, cancer centres, and biomedical and biotechnology research facilities. The rapidly growing and changing aspects of biomedical technologies have placed extraordinary demands on many professionals in the healthcare sector. The minor program aims to expose students to these new methods and technologies, integrated with the underlying anatomy and physiology of tissue systems. The knowledge and skills obtained can be applied to graduate studies, medical school or post-baccalaureate degrees in one of the many healthcare professions.",

We owe to the Greeks the roots of much of our literature, science, philosophy and art, while the Romans gave the still living legacy of their language, literature and law to an empire that stretched from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf. To allow the student to share in this rich heritage, the Department of Classics offers courses in the languages, literature, history, philosophy and civilization of Greece and Rome.\nOur courses in Greek and Roman Civilization are for students who wish to gain a general understanding of classical antiquity and are the usual basis for further work in Classics. The 2000 and 3000 level courses treat particular subjects and periods, but none of the Classics courses requires a knowledge of Greek or Latin.\nThere are, however, courses in the Greek and Latin languages for both beginning and advanced students. Those who wish to learn Greek and Latin are urged to begin their studies as early as possible in their university careers.\nStudents who pass in Classics 1010, 1020, 3120, 3420, 4310 and 4320 may claim credit for these courses in the Department of History.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

With the opening of Eastern Europe, the German language has gained prominence as a lingua franca in this region.\nGerman is not presently taught in P.E.I.'s high schools, UPEI presents the only opportunity for learning this language. This means that students wishing to study German start with 101 which demands no prior background in the language. Those who have had some contact with the language either through exchanges, family background, or travel may enter at a higher level (1020, 2010, 2020, etc.). Courses designated 1010-1020 or 2010-2020 are basically language courses, while courses above these levels focus mainly on cultural studies.",

Students acquire technical training and practical experience in Journalism (primarily during study at Holland College) and also acquire breadth of knowledge, content exposure, and skills in research, problem-solving, and critical thinking associated with a liberal arts education (primarily during study at UPEI). \nStudents normally undertake one year of study at the University, then complete the two-year Journalism program at Holland College (earning a Holland College diploma), before undertaking a final year of study at the University. The final year of study normally includes an opportunity for journalistic writing either at the University or arranged through Holland College. Deviations from the normal sequence of study between the University and Holland College are permitted. In such cases, at least five courses (15 semester-hours) of study must be completed after the Holland College diploma is earned.",

Students are provided with foundational science courses as well as senior specialized courses in the life sciences at the university level to complement the strong hands-on technical training acquired during the college diploma program. On-the-job training is provided for all students.\nThere are two paths into this program, so students can either start at Holland College or UPEI, and end up with the same articulated degree. The technical lab-based content is covered at Holland College in the Bioscience Technology diploma program, either during the first two years of the degree (for students who start at Holland College; Path 1) or in year 3 (for students who start at UPEI; Path 2). \nNote: Current UPEI students cannot declare Biotechnology as a major. If you are a current UPEI student and wish to enter the Biotechnology program, you must submit a new application.",

A top priority is to respond to the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action in a concrete manner by encouraging First Nations, Métis, and Inuit individuals to apply to the Bachelor of Education.\nThe Bachelor of Education (BEd) is a 12-month post-degree program beginning in May consisting of 60 credit hours in education courses. This program is designed to provide the variety of courses and extended field experiences through which students can develop the knowledge and skills needed to teach in the modern classroom. It is the opportunity for students to direct their studies in Primary/Elementary (K–6) or Intermediate/Senior (7–12) and also pursue optional additional study through a focus in International, Indigenous, Early Learning, or Adult Education.\nWe asked our BEd students why they decided on UPEI for their BEd degree. The responses fell into three main categories:\nThe ability to complete the degree in 12 months\nInternational, Indigenous, Early Learning, and Adult Education study foci\nProgram reputation and quality\nThese responses illustrate the strengths of our BEd program and the multiple options available to our students. One student stated, &quot;UPEI is one of the most forward-thinking universities in Canada offering a BEd... choosing UPEI is a no-brainer,&quot; and we tend to agree.\nStudents in the Faculty of Education are encouraged to think critically and creatively about the purpose and practice of education in local communities and global society. Our professors recognize that a supportive and inclusive learning environment cultivates a healthy spirit of enquiry in our students. The close rapport between students and professors is often cited as the most valued aspect of a student’s experience in the UPEI education program.",

A student can start the pre-vet program in any semester, but it is best if started in September.\nThe pre-vet stream is an advising structure that helps guide future applicants to the DVM program and supports progress toward a Bachelor of Science degree. To ensure students are also working toward a degree program, and receiving appropriate advising throughout their studies, pre-vet students will be admitted into the Bachelor of Science with a Major in Biology Life Sciences Specialization.\nPlease note: Admission to the DVM program is competitive. Each year many students apply for one of the seats available in the program. Students who enter the pre-veterinary stream are not guaranteed entry into the DVM program. As well, a student's application to the DVM program is assessed on other criteria besides grades, including residency. Potential DVM applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the veterinary admissions section of the calendar for a complete description of DVM admission requirements.",

            "introduction": "The UPEI Bachelor of Science in Applied Climate Change and Adaptation program provides students with a strong foundation in climate sciences complemented by courses in climate related policy and cultural impacts of climate change. The degree offers strong comprehensive theory-based courses and a high level of experiential and applied learning. Courses are designed to develop well-rounded students who have a high level of climate change science knowledge supported by highly relevant skills needed to utilize climate change related technology. Faculty members teaching within the Bachelor of Science in Applied Climate Change and Adaptation program are focused on providing quality instruction and student growth within a cohort-based learning community. Graduates of the program will emerge ready to pursue various climate change related careers, professional studies, or graduate education.\nThis program of study examines &quot;climate change adaptation&quot; which refers to the adjustments that societies or ecosystems make to limit the negative effects of climate change or to take advantage of opportunities provided by a changing climate. Adaptation can range from a farmer planting more drought-resistant crops to a coastal community evaluating how best to protect its infrastructure from rising sea level. Climate change is already impacting societies and ecosystems around the world, and many impacts are expected to increase as global temperatures continue to rise. While reducing greenhouse gas emissions is required to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, a certain amount of global warming is inevitable, due to the long-lasting nature of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere, and to heat already stored in the oceans. Adapting to the changes that are already underway, and preparing for future climate change, can help reduce the risks societies will face from climate change.\nYears 1 and 2 of the program will be delivered at the UPEI campus located in Charlottetown, PEI.\nYears 3 and 4 of the program will be delivered at the Canadian Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation located in St. Peter’s, PEI.",

            "introduction": "Island Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to promote an understanding of selected features of the world's small islands, including their geographies, ecologies, cultures, political systems, histories, and societies.\nThe Island Studies program has three primary goals:\nfirst, to engage students in an emerging, international academic discussion of islands' distinctive characteristics, challenges, and opportunities;\nsecond, to study Prince Edward Island as a specific example of an island bearing these characteristics and playing out these challenges and opportunities;\nand, third, to study islands in a comparative and international framework.\nPrince Edward Islanders may call PEI &quot;the Island,&quot; but they know that their island shares the world's seas with many small islands. Each sea-bound stretch of land faces its own particular challenges, but international discussions among the world's island peoples continue to reveal many characteristics that islands share.\nThe interdisciplinary Minor in Island Studies at the University of Prince Edward Island allows students to study some of the specific characteristics of islands. Some courses focus on one island — Prince Edward Island — but that one island is understood within an international, comparative framework, among other small islands whose differences and similarities offer limitless lessons.\nLessons from small islands come from many disciplines — from geography, sociology, education, and political studies; from biology and physics; from English and history. As an interdisciplinary program, UPEI's Minor in Island Studies encourages students to make critical connections among studies from diverse fields to expand their knowledge of islands.\nThe University of Prince Edward Island is uniquely placed to offer Canada's only Minor in Island Studies. The University already houses the Institute of Island Studies, one of the world's leading small islands research and public policy institutes. The academic program in Island Studies balances the University's traditional strength in researching and teaching Prince Edward Island topics with its increasing reputation for advancing international island studies.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

A top priority is to respond to the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action in a concrete manner by encouraging First Nations, Métis, and Inuit individuals to apply to the Bachelor of Education.\nThe Bachelor of Education (BEd) is a 12-month post-degree program beginning in May consisting of 60 credit hours in education courses. This program is designed to provide the variety of courses and extended field experiences through which students can develop the knowledge and skills needed to teach in the modern classroom. It is the opportunity for students to direct their studies in Primary/Elementary (K–6) or Intermediate/Senior (7–12) and also pursue optional additional study through a focus in International, Indigenous, Early Learning, or Adult Education.\nWe asked our BEd students why they decided on UPEI for their BEd degree. The responses fell into three main categories:\nThe ability to complete the degree in 12 months\nInternational, Indigenous, Early Learning, and Adult Education study foci\nProgram reputation and quality\nThese responses illustrate the strengths of our BEd program and the multiple options available to our students. One student stated, &quot;UPEI is one of the most forward-thinking universities in Canada offering a BEd... choosing UPEI is a no-brainer,&quot; and we tend to agree.\nStudents in the Faculty of Education are encouraged to think critically and creatively about the purpose and practice of education in local communities and global society. Our professors recognize that a supportive and inclusive learning environment cultivates a healthy spirit of enquiry in our students. The close rapport between students and professors is often cited as the most valued aspect of a student’s experience in the UPEI education program.",

In the past introductory courses have been offered in Chinese, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Mi'kmaq, and Scottish Gaelic. For Japanese or other Asian languages see Asian Studies.\nLanguage Studies have always been an integral part of university studies. Such studies complement many areas of study and are recommended by other disciplines such as:\nEnglish\nMusic\nHistory\nPhilosophy\nReligious Studies\nFine Arts\nSocial Sciences\nLanguage studies are seen as preparation for graduate studies, education programs, travel, and work abroad. They form a unique addition to a student's university education, with the variety of teaching and learning techniques adding variety, balance, or counter-balance to the education process.\nGlobal markets are competing for supremacy, in Europe (with Germany as the pivotal point), the Americas (North and South America), and Asia (Japanese). Prince Edward Island is not removed from this struggle of the internationalization of commerce. Learning a language also helps alleviate, to varying degrees, a lack of knowledge regarding the intricacies and elementary aspects of English on the part of our students.",

            "introduction": "The Diversity and Social Justice Studies program at the University of Prince Edward Island explores scholarship and theories about identity categories (gender, sexuality, race, etc) and their relationship to power and knowledge. Through core and cross-listed courses students examine identity as a category of analysis, investigate the construction of social differences, and explore the impact that these considerations have on social structures and practices and knowledge production.\nDiversity and Social Justice Studies recognizes that questions of social identity make a difference to people's lives; it researches how taking identities into account changes what we know and can know about social formations; it explores the importance of &quot;differences&quot; between people, recognizing that &quot;difference&quot; is often about (unequal) power relations; it investigates how identity markers such as gender, race, sexuality, (dis) abilities, national identity, etc. make a difference to people’s positioning in the world and thus also to what a more just world can look like; and it creates new scholarship that acknowledges the difference that considerations of identity make to how we know and can act in the world.\nDiversity and Social Justice Studies (DSJS) was named as one of three &quot;standout programs&quot; in the 2017 Maclean's Canadian Universities Guidebook!\nDiversity and Social Justice Studies is a self-reflexive project — that is, in addition to generating new knowledge that takes social identities into consideration, it also always asks questions about the construction of those categories of identity themselves. Thus, in Diversity and Social Justice Studies, identity is more than a description or variable to take into consideration; it is an area of constant question and contestation even as its overall concern is to explore what is meant by “social justice.” The academic field of Diversity and Social Justice Studies involves the critical examination of existing theories and research and the expansion of knowledge through generating new questions across a wide variety of disciplines and issues.\nA degree in Diversity and Social Justice Studies gives students expertise and flexibility in a number of different fields, and provides them with critical-thinking skills and the kind of background and training more and more relevant to today's world. In Diversity and Social Justice Studies, students acquire: knowledge and social awareness about differences between groups of people and respect for that diversity; the capacity to ask critical questions about how the world is organized—and to  posit other possibilities; and broad communication skills and the ability to see, understand, and translate multiple points of view for different audiences. Pursuing a program of study in Diversity and Social Justice Studies strengthens individual intellectual and personal development, and is valuable preparation for a variety of career fields after graduation, including (although not limited to!) law, administration, non-profit organizations and NGOs, social work, education, health professions, life sciences, academia, government service, business, counselling, journalism, leisure and recreation, and library science, among others.\nWant to know more about the program?

            "introduction": "Economics belongs to the branch of knowledge known as the &quot;Social Sciences.&quot; The social sciences deal with both intergenerational and intra-generational interactions between human beings in a society.\nHuman activities can, of course, be studied from many different perspectives. We could look at humans as political, psychological, historical, or economic beings. A political scientist, for example, would analyze the political activities of the people while an economist would examine activities related to their livelihood. Human beings, in order to fulfil their innate desire for food and shelter, engage in activities that lead them to the production of goods such as food, clothing, and housing, as well as services. These acts of production and consumption to satisfy human wants form the very basis of the subject matter of Economics. Perhaps observing people engaged in this pursuit, Alfred Marshall defined economics as &quot;a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.&quot;\nSince the ordinary business of life involves the use of limited natural and human-made resources (capital), people have always been interested in making the best possible use of these resources. This efficient use of resources has been the underlying theme in economics. Hence, the most succinct definition of economics would be that economics deals with the efficient utilization of scarce resources to satisfy human wants. Scarcity gives legitimacy to economics. If there is no scarcity, there is no economic problem.\nThe discipline of Economics is built upon two strands of theory: Microeconomic Theory and Macroeconomic Theory. Microeconomic deals with the study of individual units in an economy, such as consumers, producers, and the interaction of these units in a given market structure. Macroeconomic theory, on the other hand, deals with the economy as a whole. Here we analyze the problems related to unemployment, growth, inflation, and the balance of payments. Most of the other courses in Economics are applied courses which use the concepts of Microeconomic Theory and/ or Macroeconomic Theory. An understanding of the relationship between these two theory courses and other fields in economics is usually helpful in planning your selection of courses.",

Primary Health Care is defined by the World Health Organization (1978) as &quot;essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford.&quot; The purpose of the program is to prepare nurses to practice according to the concepts and principles of Primary Health Care.\nIn keeping with the basis of Primary Health Care, nurses collaborate with clients, other health care providers, and people from other sectors of society in promoting health. Nursing roles range from direct caregiver to formulator of healthy public policy and include advocate, leader, educator, researcher, and program developer.",

Students are provided with foundational science courses as well as senior specialized courses in the life sciences at the university level to complement the strong hands-on technical training acquired during the college diploma program. On-the-job training is provided for all students.\nThere are two paths into this program, so students can either start at Holland College or UPEI, and end up with the same articulated degree. The technical lab-based content is covered at Holland College in the Bioscience Technology diploma program, either during the first two years of the degree (for students who start at Holland College; Path 1) or in year 3 (for students who start at UPEI; Path 2). \nNote: Current UPEI students cannot declare Biotechnology as a major. If you are a current UPEI student and wish to enter the Biotechnology program, you must submit a new application.",

Since then, the Theatre Studies Program has undergone a complete overhaul. The Program is now focused on developing practical performance skills and advanced theatre skills, such as directing and criticism.\nCurrently, there are two Theatre Studies courses cross-listed with English and open to all students. As well, students can complete a Minor in Theatre Studies. \nIt's easy to get involved in theatre on the UPEI campus, through Vagabond Productions, the production company for the Theatre Studies Program, and/or through the UPEI Theatre Society, which is the student-run extracurricular theatre group on campus. Over the years, both have produced popular shows. Visit our Theatre Studies at UPEI website to find out about auditions, see photos of past shows, and find out how to get involved.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

Students enrolled in the minor examine science through the lens of anthropology, history, gender, sociology, philosophy and culture. This includes assessing how science was and is practiced, how science shapes and is shaped by the professionals who practice it, how science is represented in the media and other public arenas, and how various technosciences blur the boundaries between nature and society.\nThe Social Studies of Science minor is especially well suited to Arts students who wish to evaluate the powerful role of science in society, and to Science students who wish to explore more thoroughly how their field of study relates to the broader societal concerns about science. Social Studies of Science minors learn to think critically and creatively about how we define science, the multiple roles of science in society, and how science has become such a convincing way of understanding the world. This program strengthens students’ capacity to pursue careers in public policy, the health sciences, engineering, science journalism, and law.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

Foundational science courses (e.g., General Chemistry) and senior analytical environmental science courses (e.g., Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, Marine Biology) complement the strong field training acquired during the college diploma program. Students graduating from an accredited NAWTA college program with a minimum of a 70% average are eligible to apply to UPEI for formal entry into the Bachelor of Wildlife Conservation degree program.\nOur faculty hold grants from the Natural Sciences and Research Council of Canada, Canada Foundation for Innovation, among others and have research programs in arctic insect ecology, watershed ecology, pollination biology, coastal habitat ecology, animal habitat fragmentation, aquatic toxicology, plant ecological genetics, among others.\nEntry to the program is restricted to September of each year and applications must be received by June 1. Once accepted to UPEI, students will undertake a rigorous program of 20 courses, 15 of which will be required, with an additional 5 courses to be chosen from a list of acceptable electives. Students who are accepted to the program must be able to demonstrate that they have already been vaccinated for Rabies, or obtain a Rabies vaccination during the first year of their program. Students are subject to all of the Academic Regulations of the University.",

Primary Health Care is defined by the World Health Organization (1978) as &quot;essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford.&quot; The purpose of the program is to prepare nurses to practice according to the concepts and principles of Primary Health Care.\nIn keeping with the basis of Primary Health Care, nurses collaborate with clients, other health care providers, and people from other sectors of society in promoting health. Nursing roles range from direct caregiver to formulator of healthy public policy and include advocate, leader, educator, researcher, and program developer.",

            "introduction": "Over 600 million people speak Spanish. In the United States, it is the second language. Spanish is becoming increasingly important and popular in Canada as NAFTA and other commercial links are established with Spain and Latin America. This creates a need for translators, interpreters, and teachers, as Spanish speaking persons are needed in tourism, finance, management, diplomacy, consulate, and embassy work.\nSpanish is an excellent complement to UPEI degrees in Business, Veterinary Medicine, and Environmental Science, and for individuals seeking employment opportunities in the United States, Latin America, and Spain.\n\nUPEI presents the only opportunity in Prince Edward Island for learning this language. This means that most students wishing to study Spanish start with 1000-level courses which require no prior background in the language. Those who have had some contact with the language through exchanges, family background, or travel may enter at a higher level. Students who have taken Spanish at the high school level will write a placement test.\nCourses in the 1000 and 2000 levels are chiefly language courses, while courses above these levels focus mainly on cultural studies. Students may complete a seven-course minor in Spanish or a major. In the latter case; however, two of the 14 semester courses must be taken in one of the partner institutions the Modern Languages department has with the University of Salamanca (Spain), Academia de Humanismo Cristiano (Chile), and Universidad de la República (Uruguay).",

A fundamental understanding of chemistry is also important and interesting for its own sake. There is a great demand for chemists in many industries and government agencies. In fact, the chemical industry in Charlottetown and the rest of Canada is a booming business.\nAt UPEI we focus on providing truly excellent undergraduate and graduate programs while carrying out innovative chemical research. Our four-year BSc Honours, Majors, Minors, and Master’s degrees are accredited through the Canadian Society for Chemistry. There is a tremendous sense of excitement in both teaching and research in Chemistry at UPEI.\n\n\n \n\nThe department is located in the K. C. Irving Chemistry Centre, which is fully equipped with dedicated research labs, undergraduate teaching labs, student computer room, and &quot;smart” classrooms. We have a very active Chemistry Student Society, which organizes Chemistry Open Houses, fundraising barbecues, golf days, and other social events.",

            "introduction": "Philosophy is for the intellectually curious. We like to analyse the concepts that underpin our world views. For example: What is justice, morality, love, knowledge, nature, freedom, identity? To help you explore these questions, we offer courses in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, logic, political philosophy, environmental philosophy, the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy, among others. Our goal is to provide a nurturing, respectful, and engaging environment to help you craft well-articulated, well-defended, autonomous thought.\nApart from a major and a minor in philosophy, we also offer an honour’s program for select students. Our majors have gone on to graduate programs in philosophy at Concordia, Dalhousie, McGill, McMaster, Queen’s, Simon Fraser, Toronto, UBC, Victoria, Waterloo, and York, to name a few. Many others pursue successful law degrees. Others have pursued careers in health research, journalism, education, and business. Having a BA in philosophy tells potential employers that you are a reliable, intelligent, and effective problem solver who can work independently. Of course, the intrinsic benefit from philosophy resides in being an autonomous, authentic human – no matter where life takes you.\nAs with anything, the more you put into philosophy, the more you will get out of it. We love voracious readers of primary texts. We love critical, creative, and reflective thinkers. We love those who recognize that philosophical argumentation requires careful support. We especially love those who can write clearly, succinctly, and offer poignant illustrations. If these are traits you love as well, it may be time to give philosophy a whirl.",

            "introduction": "The Medieval and Renaissance Studies (MARS) program is an interdisciplinary minor that invites students to examine European society and culture from Late Antiquity to 1700 from a series of diverse perspectives. It was during this exciting period that a distinctly European civilisation was forged. It was an age of faith—but also an age of brutal violence. It was a period of rigid stratification, but one which saw people chaffing to break social and cultural boundaries. Most people were illiterate, but it saw the production of some of the greatest treasures of European art and literature. It was the age of the original information revolution.\nDrawing upon the resources of a range of UPEI departments, the minor will invite students to examine and investigate the dynamics and tensions inherent in this crucial period, and to understand how these were expressed across different social and cultural fields. In so doing, students will gain a richer understanding of the origins and meaning of many familiar modern ideas and institutions that have their roots in this period. But in addressing historical problems from an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural and trans-national perspective, students will be able to imagine new answers to some of the problems facing today’s society.\nDeclaring a Minor\nCurrent students can declare a minor in this program through their myUPEI account.",

In our modern complex and diverse world, the study of history has never been more relevant. Understanding the origins and developments of institutions and ideas, tensions and conflicts, societies and civilizations improves our social awareness and provides insight into the perspectives of others, allowing us to make informed decisions about future courses of action.\nStudying history provides students with a tool box of transferable skills that will serve them well in today’s evolving job market. History students are trained to be excellent researchers, tracking down information and communicating their analysis with clarity and confidence. A History degree at UPEI will hone students’ abilities to weigh and assess evidence and expert opinion, to evaluate causes and consequences, and provide them with a foundation from which to develop practical solutions to contemporary problems. Our History graduates are pursuing successful careers in heritage and conservation, law, journalism, education, medicine, social services, policy analysis, business, communications, and digital information management.\nHistory professors at UPEI are award-winning educators and researchers with a wide variety of historical interests. Our course offerings include studies ranging from the local history of PEI to the history of global exploration; from Antiquity and the Middle Ages to the present; and themes encompassing the impact of wars and revolutions on past societies, the history of science and medicine, and the history of gender relations. Our Public History course provides students with an opportunity to gain valuable internship experience in government, heritage and cultural workplaces.\nUPEI History professors work closely with individual students, mentoring them to help them achieve their goals. The History Student Society thrives at UPEI, providing history students with a supportive, socially active university community.",

The degree program is designed to provide a highly flexible learning environment that is responsive to the dynamic needs of students and the industries that employ them.\n\n\n \n\nIn addition to fundamental science, engineering science and mathematics courses, students are required to develop skills in engineering design, communication, analysis, project management, professional ethics and more. With a solid grounding in these fundamentals, students in Program Years 3 and 4 can enhance their technical knowledge by choosing an engineering focus area:\nmechatronics\nsustainable energy\nbioresources\nPlease refer to our Welcome and Advisement package to help with first-year registration, and the four-year degree course matrix, five-year degree course matrix and the five-year degree course matrix (Winter start) for planning.\n\nOur student experience\nYou'll draw on the experience of your classmates, other senior students, professors, and knowledgeable industry experts to solve real-world problems for clients representing all industries and sectors.\nOur first-year students are introduced to design engineering in an intimate, activity-oriented, project-based environment. Dedicated faculty members work closely and interactively with clusters of students to solve design problems in a controlled environment for community organizations and private enterprises. \nSecond-year students work on projects related to mechanical and/or electrical design using the same iterative design process experienced during their first year, but with the increased responsibility of ongoing client consultations, reporting requirements, design drawings, analysis, and prototype development.\nIn students' third year, project work shifts to industry projects related to mechatronics—designing and building functioning prototypes and conducting in-depth quality analysis—to produce industry-sponsored prototypes capable of deployment for testing in an actual industrial environment.\nFourth-year students work on projects that involve the design and optimization of systems in a wide variety of applications related to bioresources, sustainable energy, and mechatronics. These projects have the potential for higher quality design, prototypes, patents, and, in some cases, commercialization.\n\nEngineered by design \nIt is increasingly recognized that understanding basic science and mathematics are only two of the many areas that are essential to professional engineering practice. Engineering students in this program must make responsible decisions based on good judgment and an ability to justify decisions within a structured analytical framework. Based on this generalist philosophy, this program is designed to develop a student’s ability to think. This fundamental requirement of engineers to think critically in response to ever-changing and complex situations is accomplished through a design stream core which relies heavily on inquiry-based learning supported by traditional lecture-based knowledge. The progression in complex thinking skills occurs over the duration of the four-year program and beyond through appreciation of lifelong learning and professional development.\nAn integrated, stream of project-based design clinic courses through all four-years of the program provides students with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills through working on real community and industry-based projects. Traditional content courses are delivered via an integrated and timely approach so that professional practice skills are developed in a simulated workplace environment. This program emphasizes design as an essential element of engineering as reflected in the Community Design Program (Year 1), and the Junior Design (Year 2) and Senior Design (Years 3 and 4) Clinics.\nThe following core design courses must be taken in succession to support the students' developing skills.\nCommunity Design Program (Program Year 1) \n1. Engineering 1210—Engineering Communications\n2. Engineering 1220—Engineering Analysis \nJunior Design Clinic (Program Year 2)\n3. Engineering 2210—Engineering Projects I\n4. Engineering 2220—Engineering Projects II \nSenior Design Clinics (Program Years 3 and 4) \n5. Engineering 3710—Project-Based Professional Practice I\n6. Engineering 3720—Project-Based Professional Practice II\n7. Engineering 4710—Project-Based Professional Practice III\n8. Engineering 4720—Project-Based Professional Practice IV",

The many answers to that question form an extensive and exciting labyrinth, and we welcome you to join our diverse department of students, staff, and faculty in exploring it. If you enjoy asking questions and pursuing dynamic student projects, you will find some of your most rewarding experiences in our department at the University of Prince Edward Island.\nPsychology is among the most expansive fields for human inquiry, ranging from what makes us human to what holds us in common with other species, through examinations of mind, emotions, and behaviours. Virtually no aspect of being human is left unexplored by our diverse faculty, including how our evolutionary roots influence our humanity and what a difference consciousness and mind can make to our understanding. We have dynamic research and teaching programmes supported by our broad traditions within behavioural neuroscience, perception and cognition, critical  historical perspectives, and developmental, humanistic, clinical,  applied psychologies.  Students benefit not only in the classroom but also through opportunities to work in research settings with faculty in each of these areas. World class researchers and award winning scholars in the classroom create connections with students that are unique to a small university. Our department has a strong core of quantitative training and has developed an equally impressive qualitative component. Students in our programme benefit from training in both of these areas to add to their skill set and the ability to ask and answer meaningful questions.\nOur inspiring multi-award winning faculty commit to student engagement through a variety of pedagogical approaches in smaller classrooms and larger ones alike. Our students strengthen their ability to work critically and creatively, to follow their curiosity with systematic rigour, and to find effective and authentic ways to communicate about their knowledge. Independent as well as collaborative scholarship is strengthened throughout the curriculum, and especially during Honours projects.  We strongly encourage a liberal education across a range of elective courses in the sciences and the arts so that students become part of an engaged citizenry. Some faculty’s focus includes academic activism and they create opportunities for social justice connections with our community. We endeavor to create a community of scholarship both within the department and with the broader university and community through interactive class projects, service learning, community discussions, formal presentations, and informal gatherings.\nOur diverse foundational BA or BSC programmes contribute to students’ careers in various ways. Our students not only acquire skills but they also have opportunities to practice them in the smaller classroom environments and to gain greater confidence in their abilities. Many students successfully launch into relevant professional programmes while others continue to thrive in their graduate studies in psychology itself.\nStudents benefit from our welcoming and friendly atmosphere in the department which is made possible by our dedicated, award winning support staff. Importantly, our students collaborate to make their experiences at UPEI even more fulfilling through the active Psychology Arts and Sciences Society (PASS). A student in our department becomes part of a community of scholarship.\nYour commitment to your studies in psychology will be enriching to you personally but it will also hold possibilities for you to expand your relationships and your role in the broader community. Your studies will be challenging, demanding you expand your world view and also your potential role as an active engaged citizen. Your journey holds rich possibilities and we invite you to explore what it means to be human at this place and time on the planet with us here at the University of Prince Edward Island.",

Students acquire technical training and practical experience in Journalism (primarily during study at Holland College) and also acquire breadth of knowledge, content exposure, and skills in research, problem-solving, and critical thinking associated with a liberal arts education (primarily during study at UPEI). \nStudents normally undertake one year of study at the University, then complete the two-year Journalism program at Holland College (earning a Holland College diploma), before undertaking a final year of study at the University. The final year of study normally includes an opportunity for journalistic writing either at the University or arranged through Holland College. Deviations from the normal sequence of study between the University and Holland College are permitted. In such cases, at least five courses (15 semester-hours) of study must be completed after the Holland College diploma is earned.",

            "introduction": "The Faculty of Sustainable Design Engineering at UPEI offers a progressive and innovative four-year Bachelor of Science in Sustainable Design Engineering degree which recognizes the need for a broad and balanced engineering education. The program follows current trends in engineering education and focuses on student outcomes. Small class sizes within an activity-based learning environment allow faculty and staff to be student-centric and to provide specific and timely input to individual students.\nStudents are exposed to a broad base of knowledge and skills in engineering science, natural science, mathematics, and complementary studies in concert with an applied project-based design stream simulating the engineering profession. Students entering the degree program will be actively engaged in the profession of engineering from day one, providing creative and sustainable solutions to society’s problems. The degree program is designed to provide a highly flexible learning environment that is responsive to the dynamic needs of students and the industries that employ them.\n\n\n \n\nIn addition to fundamental science, engineering science and mathematics courses, students are required to develop skills in engineering design, communication, analysis, project management, professional ethics and more. With a solid grounding in these fundamentals, students in Program Years 3 and 4 can enhance their technical knowledge by choosing an engineering focus area:\nmechatronics\nsustainable energy\nbioresources\nPlease refer to our Welcome and Advisement package to help with first-year registration, and the four-year degree course matrix, five-year degree course matrix and the five-year degree course matrix (Winter start) for planning.\n\nOur student experience\nYou'll draw on the experience of your classmates, other senior students, professors, and knowledgeable industry experts to solve real-world problems for clients representing all industries and sectors.\nOur first-year students are introduced to design engineering in an intimate, activity-oriented, project-based environment. Dedicated faculty members work closely and interactively with clusters of students to solve design problems in a controlled environment for community organizations and private enterprises. \nSecond-year students work on projects related to mechanical and/or electrical design using the same iterative design process experienced during their first year, but with the increased responsibility of ongoing client consultations, reporting requirements, design drawings, analysis, and prototype development.\nIn students' third year, project work shifts to industry projects related to mechatronics—designing and building functioning prototypes and conducting in-depth quality analysis—to produce industry-sponsored prototypes capable of deployment for testing in an actual industrial environment.\nFourth-year students work on projects that involve the design and optimization of systems in a wide variety of applications related to bioresources, sustainable energy, and mechatronics. These projects have the potential for higher quality design, prototypes, patents, and, in some cases, commercialization.\n\nEngineered by design \nIt is increasingly recognized that understanding basic science and mathematics are only two of the many areas that are essential to professional engineering practice. Engineering students in this program must make responsible decisions based on good judgment and an ability to justify decisions within a structured analytical framework. Based on this generalist philosophy, this program is designed to develop a student’s ability to think. This fundamental requirement of engineers to think critically in response to ever-changing and complex situations is accomplished through a design stream core which relies heavily on inquiry-based learning supported by traditional lecture-based knowledge. The progression in complex thinking skills occurs over the duration of the four-year program and beyond through appreciation of lifelong learning and professional development.\nAn integrated, stream of project-based design clinic courses through all four-years of the program provides students with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills through working on real community and industry-based projects. Traditional content courses are delivered via an integrated and timely approach so that professional practice skills are developed in a simulated workplace environment. This program emphasizes design as an essential element of engineering as reflected in the Community Design Program (Year 1), and the Junior Design (Year 2) and Senior Design (Years 3 and 4) Clinics.\nThe following core design courses must be taken in succession to support the students' developing skills.\nCommunity Design Program (Program Year 1) \n1. Engineering 1210—Engineering Communications\n2. Engineering 1220—Engineering Analysis \nJunior Design Clinic (Program Year 2)\n3. Engineering 2210—Engineering Projects I\n4. Engineering 2220—Engineering Projects II \nSenior Design Clinics (Program Years 3 and 4) \n5. Engineering 3710—Project-Based Professional Practice I\n6. Engineering 3720—Project-Based Professional Practice II\n7. Engineering 4710—Project-Based Professional Practice III\n8. Engineering 4720—Project-Based Professional Practice IV",

At the same time, may be some of the most fulfilling experiences of your career. Think you are up to the challenge? Then a degree in Family Science could be right for you. \nDo you have career aspirations that require a science background? The Family Science program is an excellent combination of traditional science courses along with courses that focus on the science of people. Students in Family Science take courses in a wide range of scientific disciplines - biology, chemistry, math and nutrition. But this is a science degree about people so you would also take courses in family dynamics, human development, family resource management, chid and family education, human sexuality, and parent-child interactions.\nFamily Science focuses on the health and well-being of individuals and families by promoting the social and physical environments that support the home and community, appropriate access to resources, and healthy family relationships. Students interested in international learning experiences should contact their faculty advisor and check out possible international exchange opportunties well ahead of time.\n&quot;I have nothing but good things to say about the Family Science program: one-on-one discussions with the professors, non-crowded classes and new friendships is what I promise you will experience during your time here.\nIn this program, I have learned endless knowledge about working with families and I have had the chance to complete a field placement with children in an elementary school where in a few years I would like to be working as a French teacher. There are endless possibilities after you graduate with a Family Science degree. You can become a family life educator, a social worker, a teacher, an early childhood educator, or work in a family resource centre.\nI would advise anyone who is planning to work with children, families and/or adults to look into this program as your undergraduate degree. The program is well done and everyone in the Department of Applied Human Sciences is rooting for you to do well in all your classes.&quot; - Natalie Gallant, Family Science student",

            "introduction": "The Faculty of Sustainable Design Engineering at UPEI offers a progressive and innovative four-year Bachelor of Science in Sustainable Design Engineering degree which recognizes the need for a broad and balanced engineering education. The program follows current trends in engineering education and focuses on student outcomes. Small class sizes within an activity-based learning environment allow faculty and staff to be student-centric and to provide specific and timely input to individual students.\nStudents are exposed to a broad base of knowledge and skills in engineering science, natural science, mathematics, and complementary studies in concert with an applied project-based design stream simulating the engineering profession. Students entering the degree program will be actively engaged in the profession of engineering from day one, providing creative and sustainable solutions to society’s problems. The degree program is designed to provide a highly flexible learning environment that is responsive to the dynamic needs of students and the industries that employ them.\n\n\n \n\nIn addition to fundamental science, engineering science and mathematics courses, students are required to develop skills in engineering design, communication, analysis, project management, professional ethics and more. With a solid grounding in these fundamentals, students in Program Years 3 and 4 can enhance their technical knowledge by choosing an engineering focus area:\nmechatronics\nsustainable energy\nbioresources\nPlease refer to our Welcome and Advisement package to help with first-year registration, and the four-year degree course matrix, five-year degree course matrix and the five-year degree course matrix (Winter start) for planning.\n\nOur student experience\nYou'll draw on the experience of your classmates, other senior students, professors, and knowledgeable industry experts to solve real-world problems for clients representing all industries and sectors.\nOur first-year students are introduced to design engineering in an intimate, activity-oriented, project-based environment. Dedicated faculty members work closely and interactively with clusters of students to solve design problems in a controlled environment for community organizations and private enterprises. \nSecond-year students work on projects related to mechanical and/or electrical design using the same iterative design process experienced during their first year, but with the increased responsibility of ongoing client consultations, reporting requirements, design drawings, analysis, and prototype development.\nIn students' third year, project work shifts to industry projects related to mechatronics—designing and building functioning prototypes and conducting in-depth quality analysis—to produce industry-sponsored prototypes capable of deployment for testing in an actual industrial environment.\nFourth-year students work on projects that involve the design and optimization of systems in a wide variety of applications related to bioresources, sustainable energy, and mechatronics. These projects have the potential for higher quality design, prototypes, patents, and, in some cases, commercialization.\n\nEngineered by design \nIt is increasingly recognized that understanding basic science and mathematics are only two of the many areas that are essential to professional engineering practice. Engineering students in this program must make responsible decisions based on good judgment and an ability to justify decisions within a structured analytical framework. Based on this generalist philosophy, this program is designed to develop a student’s ability to think. This fundamental requirement of engineers to think critically in response to ever-changing and complex situations is accomplished through a design stream core which relies heavily on inquiry-based learning supported by traditional lecture-based knowledge. The progression in complex thinking skills occurs over the duration of the four-year program and beyond through appreciation of lifelong learning and professional development.\nAn integrated, stream of project-based design clinic courses through all four-years of the program provides students with the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills through working on real community and industry-based projects. Traditional content courses are delivered via an integrated and timely approach so that professional practice skills are developed in a simulated workplace environment. This program emphasizes design as an essential element of engineering as reflected in the Community Design Program (Year 1), and the Junior Design (Year 2) and Senior Design (Years 3 and 4) Clinics.\nThe following core design courses must be taken in succession to support the students' developing skills.\nCommunity Design Program (Program Year 1) \n1.

For example, the physical, psychological, and social experiences of sport and physical activity are investigated to provide students with a holistic view of how they affect human development.\nAre you interested in sport, physical activity, and wellness? Would you like to work with children, adults and seniors and help them become and remain physically active? If so, a degree in kinesiology may be an appropriate undertaking for you.\nWithin the kinesiology degree, students take courses in areas including (but not limited to) sport psychology, exercise physiology, biomechanics of sport and physical activity, motor learning and control, human development, and research methods. Students interested in international study opportunities should contact their faculty advisor and check potential exchange opportunities well ahead of time.\nUpon degree completion, students will have the ability to apply their knowledge to a number of fields or have can continue their studies in fields such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and education. In addition, graduate studies in any of the sub-disciplines of kinesiology are possible for interested students.",

A scientific understanding of the plants and animals is, in many ways, its own reward. But it is also a pathway to a large number of exciting and fulfilling career opportunities. A biology program is a common route toward the health professions (human and veterinary medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, etc.), for which we offer strong pre-professional programs. It can also lead to careers in environmental analysis, biotechnology, laboratory diagnostics, and many other things. Biology graduates also often establish other sorts of careers (lawyer, business professional) for which the knowledge of biology can be a strong personal and professional asset.\nThe strength of our educational programs derive from the strength of our scholarly activity and research. Our faculty hold grants from the Natural Sciences and Research Council of Canada, Canada Foundation for Innovation, Atlantic Innovation Foundation, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Prince Edward Island Health Research Institute, among others. Our faculty have research programs in neurobiology, arctic insect ecology, cancer cell biology, watershed ecology, pollination biology, coastal habitat ecology, animal habitat fragmentation, heart and stroke physiology, aquatic toxicology, plant ecological genetics, among others.",

We also offer honours programs for each major. Members of our internationally-recognized faculty possess a wealth of expertise acquired through study and research in a variety of countries and social settings. Since we cover nearly every topic in society and culture, you are sure to find courses that add to your knowledge of the world and provide you with the communications and analytical skills/insights required to succeed in a wide variety of careers.\nOur graduates have also successfully entered a variety of post-graduate programs, including Masters study in sociology and anthropology, social work, education, law, international development, criminology, and law enforcement, to mention only a few.\nBecause of Sociology's broad areas of interest, a degree in sociology is an excellent preparation for a variety of careers, including further postgraduate studies in the social sciences (sociology, social work, education, law, criminology and law enforcement, international development). Sociology graduates have always been valuable players in both public and private sectors; their rich and multifaceted understanding of society, together with their skills in social analysis, communications and problem solving, make them in-demand in this constantly shifting social and economic world.\nSimilarly, a degree in Anthropology is a springboard for entry into a variety of professions. Our graduates have distinguished themselves in education, the legal and law enforcement professions, overseas development projects, large and small-scale corporations (including NGO's), museums, human resource departments, advertising and product research/development (some corporations even have their own anthropology units). The possibilities are endless.",

These positions are all paid and they give you a chance to experience different types of jobs, workplace settings and employers, and gain important transferable skills, all while you are a physics student at UPEI.\nSome of our recent physics graduates have gone on to graduate school, others to medical school, some have received education degrees and are teaching in the school system, some are professors and researchers at Universities, and others are working in industry.",
