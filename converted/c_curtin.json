As a result, there is a growing demand for graduates in Korean studies.\nIn this course you\u2019ll explore Korean society, culture, history, politics and international relations and gain strong competency in the Korean language. You\u2019ll also delve into some of the most intriguing societal and cultural issues of the Korean peninsula, ranging from South Korea\u2013North Korea relations to the success of Hallyu, which refers to the rising wave of popularity of South Korean culture.\nThe course is also designed to give you a transformative learning experience so that you can work and engage comfortably in diverse cultural environments \u2013 an attribute that is increasingly vital as cultures and industries become more globally entwined. Importantly, the language learning incorporates in-class activities that have a strong focus on active learning and developing communication skills in real-world contexts.\nTo study this major you are not expected to have prior knowledge of the Korean language or any other Asian language.\nKorean Studies is offered as part of the Bachelor of Arts. You may choose to broaden your knowledge and skills with a second major, or select elective units or a specialisation that supports your career goals.
