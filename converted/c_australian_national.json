The ANU Bachelor of Languages is a wonderful way to take advantage of that, through the study of two (or more) languages, in combination with other areas of interest.\u00a0Your language education experience is designed to engage you with the structural, grammatical and idiomatic components of your chosen language or languages. This is further contextualised using cultural, social and historical concepts, issues and topics. You can start at beginning level, or at higher levels if you have past experience. Exciting opportunities exist for you to immerse yourself in your chosen language and culture through study abroad, and to combine your language study with a range of other areas.   The Bachelor of Languages (with Year in Asia) is the perfect degree to establish yourself as a future leader in the Asian Century. You will combine study at ANU with one year at a university in an Asian location like Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul or Bangkok. Your Year in Asia will build on the strengths of your Bachelor degree. You will develop an advanced level of language proficiency and an exceptional capacity to understand the societies and cultures of our region.

As a member of our interdisciplinary research community you will have the opportunity to explore your interests through a diverse range of disciplines including: history,  anthropology, international relations, gender, culture, strategic studies, sociology, political science, language and linguistics, literature, law and regulation, archaeology, and economics.    You will receive one-on-one mentoring from a range of world-leading researchers at the forefront of their fields and develop your capacity for independent research and critical thinking in an academically rigorous learning environment.    You will join a dynamic cohort of students in the PhB, interacting through special research seminars, and connecting with international peers through internship and exchange opportunities.    The flexible nature of the PhB (HaSS) allows you and your academic mentors to design the program to suit your interests and includes advanced PhB-only courses tailored to provide you with the high-level academic skills you need to lead in your research and analysis career.    During your final years of study you will be encouraged to undertake fieldwork abroad as you embark on a year-long independent research project under the guidance of an academic supervisor.

You will be taken on a language learning journey designed to facilitate in-depth engagement with the linguistic and cultural aspects of your chosen language or languages. You can choose to study a wide selection of languages, many of which are not available at any other university in Australia. You can complete the Diploma by doing the equivalent of a major in one language (8 courses), or, for those who have prior learning, by doing an Advanced minor (4 courses) in one language as well as either a second minor (4 courses) in another language or four other language-related courses from those listed under the Program Requirements. The Diploma of Languages can be studied concurrently with other ANU programs. Current ANU students who apply to this program will be signalling their intent to complete the Diploma of Languages and their other ANU program concurrently.\u00a0Applicants commencing in Semester 2 are advised that beginner level language courses are only available for students starting in Semester 1. Enrolment in Semester 2 courses will be subject to a language placement test, and the availability of an appropriate course is not guaranteed. Note that in most cases, the Diploma will be completed on a part-time basis over 3-4 years. Completion on a full-time basis is also possible in limited cases if students have the required language competency upon commencement.

This highly selective program provides a challenging course of study for students who have a strong interest in and aptitude for graduate research work.Students are expected to acquire a strong foundation in critical analysis and depth in the principles of each subject. They are closely involved in undergraduate research with at least 25 per cent of their graduation requirements based upon independent research.This is a four-year, Honours only, research-based degree. You will spend three semesters in residence at your host university and will write your Honours thesis at your home university. If your institution of primary enrolment is the NUS, you spend the first three semesters there, your next three semesters at ANU and your final two semesters back at NUS.If you are primarily enrolled at ANU, you will spend the first two semesters at ANU, the next three semesters at the NUS and the last three semesters at ANU.The course of study in each major is indicated in the tables below. There is significant flexibility and you can tailor your program of study in consultation with an assigned academic mentor at your home institution, with approval from the relevant coordinator in both universities.Admission to this program is based on meeting the minimum selection rank requirement, submission of the Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) supplementary form and the receipt of two referee reports in support of your application.
