You’ll have access to the most recent research findings from Lincoln’s laboratories as well as research from overseas. The wine industry in the Canterbury and Marlborough regions of Aotearoa-New Zealand has been heavily influenced by Lincoln University’s research findings. Our work led directly to the establishment of cool-climate viticulture and wine making in South Island regions.\nYou can find out about the Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences Honours projects \nhere\n.",

Once you have completed the degree, you will hold two Lincoln University qualifications (the DUS and your bachelor's degree). \nIf you choose not to continue with a bachelor's degree programme, you will graduate with the DUS only. \nDepending on your entry level and qualifications, you can complete the DUS in two or three semesters.",
