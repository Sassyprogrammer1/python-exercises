The aviation industry requires a large corporate world to function successfully. The industry is becoming more complex and sophisticated, meaning employers are looking for graduates who have wide industry knowledge, tertiary qualifications and all-round capabilities.\nThe Bachelor of Aviation (Management) addresses these issues to produce graduates with essential skills and knowledge in the fields of science, engineering, interpersonal relations, the environment and management. This skill base provides a solid foundation upon which you can expect to advance to positions of management and influence within the aviation industry.\nStudents are exposed to current aviation topics and often work in teams to solve contemporary air transport problems. Learning exercises range from operating a start-up airline in a management simulation to exploring the cognitive abilities of humans in the fast-developing environment of aviation.\nGraduates of the management degree have a broad education that provides a solid base for pursuing a career in aviation. Many graduates have enjoyed the flexibility to grow their careers through various roles in airlines and related industries. The degree is designed to prepare graduates for employment in international and regional airlines of all sizes. Other prospective employers include airports, government agencies such as the Australian Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, Air Services Australia, tourism authorities, freight forwarders and airport ground handling companies. Students looking more widely are well prepared to join consulting firms, IT firms and air safety authorities.\n\nAviation requires many disciplines and skills and is increasingly looking to people who have appropriate tertiary qualifications and the personal qualities needed for a career in the dynamic environment of the aviation industry. The Bachelor of Aviation (Management) aims to produce aviation professionals of this calibre.\nThe Concurrent Graduate Diploma in Flying (UNSW Program 5536)\nAustralian citizens and permanent residents, and New Zealand citizens with special Australian residency visas may concurrently study for the Graduate Diploma in Flying.
