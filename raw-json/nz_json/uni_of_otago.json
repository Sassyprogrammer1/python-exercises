Nature has productive limits, so it has been necessary to develop alternative but complementary strategies to feed the world’s increasing population. The innovative technologies that produce alternative foods require natural resources that are renewable and sustainable.\nThe Agricultural Innovation programme is designed to develop future leaders in agriculture. The focus is on science and technology, but you will also gain an understanding and appreciation for agriculture in broader contexts including economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects.\nGovernment projections are that there will be 50,000 additional skilled jobs generated within the agricultural sector by 2050. Agricultural Innovation has been developed to produce graduates with specialist but diverse skills for a career in agriculture or the rural sector.",

We focus on the importance of communities, including Māori communities, as well as understanding how the environment relates to being active.\nPhysical education, activity and health will also appeal to those interested in teaching or coaching sport and exercise. It is designed to equip students with a strong background in the biophysical and socio-cultural sub-disciplines of human movement.\nIn addition, there is a strong emphasis on applied practice and theory.",

It affects not only our identities, but our income, our family relationships and friendships, the value and meanings we attach to other people and activities, what we eat and how we dress, and even how we speak. Gender Studies explores categories such as “women”, “men”, “trans”, or “non-binary” and how they can be fundamental to our own and others’ understandings of who we are.",

These civilisations have had an immense influence on the development of the modern world – on words and ideas, religion, literature, art and architecture, drama and philosophy. Many legal and political systems also have their roots in these ancient cultures.\nClassics aims to understand these ancient civilisations and appreciate what they achieved and how important they have been in historical terms. At the same time, Classics students are challenged to confront the major questions and problems that ancient people faced, and which humanity has continued to face down the ages: human behaviour, human society, ethics, war, politics and religion – indeed, the whole meaning and purpose of life.",

We are producing it, collecting it, wrangling it, analysing it, modelling it, understanding it, visualising it, using it on a scale that seemed impossible not so long ago.\nData Science is fundamentally about how we can learn from data and how we can meaningfully use it to improve our world. Studying Data Science leads to opportunities in fields as diverse as banking and biotechnology, entertainment and education, gaming and government, medicine and manufacturing, retail and research.\nData Science is also a broad area of study. At Otago, the Data Science programme pulls together the best that computer science, information science, and statistics have to offer while stressing application and understanding of the impact of Data Science on society.\nInformation on this page is about Data Science as a major for undergraduate science degrees, and as an endorsement for the Diploma for Graduates. The University of Otago also offers the Master of Business Data Science, a one-year postgraduate degree with a strong business focus:  Master of Business Data Science (MBusDataSc)",

Mathematics looks at the distribution of prime numbers, the properties of geometric figures, how dependent variables change, and what happens when you add up infinitely many terms.\nStudying these ideas lays the foundation for using mathematics to solve real-life problems.",

            "introduction": "Why people eat what they eat.\nConsumers are becoming increasingly demanding in what they choose to eat: low-carb, vitamin-enriched, fat-free, organic, sustainably-produced, isotonic, carbon-neutral, fortified, genetically-modified, healthy… and then there’s flavour, safety and affordability. Finding out what people in different markets around the world want, and how to produce it and get it there in top condition is a real challenge for food producers.\nThat’s where Consumer Food Scientists come in. Their goal is to help turn product ideas into reality. Consumer Food Science students learn about the technical, socio-economic and psychological factors influencing food choice, food production, the subtle art of advertising, food labelling and the regulatory environment.",

In the following years, opportunities are made available for specialisation in writing for other media such as film, dance, television or theatre.\nThere are no minimum entry requirements for the first-year composition papers, although students with little or no music reading ability are strongly encouraged to up-skill in the first semester through the paper MUSI 191 Introduction to Music.\nStudents who complete the 36 point third-year paper MUSI 331 Composition Projects can choose to have their Bachelor of Music (MusB) degree endorsed in composition.",

Existing students enrolled in this major may continue in the subject. Please see the new interdisciplinary major in Marine Science.\nThis watery world is so challenging to explore, that we have more detailed maps for the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Venus.\nYet understanding our ocean planet is essential for meeting the challenges of our collective future. The physical, biological, chemical, and geological processes that power the Earth system unite in the ocean, determining Earth’s climate, regulating the composition of our atmosphere, supporting human civilisation, and sparking our curiosity.\nOtago is uniquely placed to study these interlinked processes and their effects on our lives. The Southern Ocean is on our doorstep, with a wide range of marine environments easily accessible to our research fleet. We work from shallow harbours to the deep ocean, around sub-Antarctic islands and in majestic fiords, alongside temperate coastlines and floating over tropical reefs.",

They comprise more than 50 per cent of the life forms on our planet, yet only around 1 per cent have been identified and studied. Infectious microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses, can attack our bodies and we rely on our immune system to protect us. Thus the relationship between microbes and immune cells is critical for our survival.\n\nThe University of Otago is the only institution in New Zealand offering bachelor’s degrees in both Microbiology AND Infection and Immunity. The courses provide insights into the unseen world of microbes and the immune system, and an understanding of the practical applications arising from their study.",

We learn about species, populations, and communities in a wide range of habitats from alpine to marine, and from semi-arid grasslands to cloud- and rainforests.\nEcology is a multidisciplinary subject which links departments across the University: Botany, Geography, Geology, Information Science, Marine Science, Maths, Philosophy, Statistics, Surveying, and Zoology.\nThe Ecology Degree Programme at Otago is organised to allow you to build pathways as you discover your interests – for example, animal and plant ecophysiology, freshwater ecology, marine ecology, plant ecology, molecular and evolutionary ecology, as well as paleoecology, plant–animal interactions and information systems.",

While marketing encompasses these activities, we believe that marketing also has the role of promoting positive change within individuals and society as a whole.\nStudents from all backgrounds choose to study marketing, and when you graduate you can apply marketing in many diverse ways.

Mathematics looks at the distribution of prime numbers, the properties of geometric figures, how dependent variables change, and what happens when you add up infinitely many terms.\nStudying these ideas lays the foundation for using mathematics to solve real-life problems.",

You’ll investigate religion’s evolutionary origins, psychological underpinnings and historical development as well as its links with modern politics, law and social movements.\nLooking beyond ‘mainstream’ religions, you’ll examine those new forms of spiritual practice that have emerged alongside the traditional religions. Religion approaches these phenomena with both critical spirit and empathy and offers explanations that believers might be reluctant to accept, while also attempting to understand the believer’s point of view.",

Animals are fascinating and there is so much to learn about them – the Zoology courses at Otago will blow your mind.\nZoology is the study of animals, their behaviour, their physiology and evolution, as well as their interactions with each other and with their environment. Zoologists also study how animals evolved and the impact of environmental change on their survival. They search for ways to manage wildlife populations and to conserve rare and endangered species, such as takahe, frogs and tuatara. They study costs and benefits of conservation and ways to enhance species survival.",

Today’s policy challenges are more complicated than ever, and PPE’s interdisciplinary course of study prepares students to meet them.",

Students complete a challenging course of study in logic, ethics, collective action, human behaviour, political theory, economics, and the history of ideas.\nOriginally developed at Oxford and now available around the globe (and only at Otago in New Zealand), our programme in PPE includes a foundation in the classic texts of the human sciences, engagement with the best new ideas about society, and analysis of present-day policy challenges. Today’s policy challenges are more complicated than ever, and PPE’s interdisciplinary course of study prepares students to meet them.",
