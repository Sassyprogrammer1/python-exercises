The language courses are sequential – each course builds on the knowledge gained in the previous one - so your language studies spread across three years. You’ll gain an additional qualification and add a language to your résumé.\nOur diploma is open to domestic students from other universities. We also welcome Australian or New Zealand citizens—or permanent Australian visa holders—who’ve already completed an undergraduate degree.\nWhat will you do?\nWe offer the following languages at both beginner and advanced levels:\nNote: it’s not possible to study Indonesian Studies, Italian Studies or Modern Greek Studies as part of a Diploma in Languages on its own. These languages (taught by Flinders University staff at our North Terrace campus) are only available if you’re studying a University of Adelaide degree at the same time. They’re not open to graduates or students from other universities.\nWhere could it take you?\nLearning another language opens doors in a changing world. From social work to international business, a Diploma in Languages provides greater insight and a competitive edge.",

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords. For details regarding the audition rounds and the application process, please visit the Elder Conservatorium of Music ().",

After auditioning you may be asked to return later in the day or the next day to join a group audition in dance and further singing and action work. Offers will be made on the basis of the audition, the Musicianship test and academic achievement. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts.

The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

But at every stage, you’ll be challenged by even greater academic demands. Ultimately, you’ll emerge as a clear future leader in your field.\nWhat will you do?\nYour first year is all about discovery. You’ll investigate a number of scientific fields, before choosing a major to focus on in years two and three (see Bachelor of Science (Advanced) for choices).\nDuring this time you’ll enjoy the same fantastic opportunities offered to all Bachelor of Science (Advanced) students. That includes developing advanced research skills, making real-world connections through internships, and potentially gaining global experience with international study. In your honours year, you’ll then advance along either a disciplinary research or professional skills pathway.\nThe disciplinary research path is the most research-intensive. Working with a specific researcher or research group, you’ll undertake a major research project, together with advanced coursework, in one of the following study areas:\nThe less research-intensive professional skills path will expand your scientific knowledge and skills more broadly. You’ll undertake a major industry or community-related project, along with advanced general coursework, in your choice of:\nSearch for an honours project\nWhere could it take you?\nDepending on your study choices, you could emerge well-prepared for senior and leadership roles in a specific scientific discipline or as a science generalist, in the public or private sector. Or perhaps you’ll aim higher still and go on to master’s-level research. Wherever you want to go, you’ll be perfectly placed.\nDirect access to industry leaders and paid internship opportunities: The Academy by DeloitteThis degree gives you the opportunity to be part of our new The Academy by Deloitte You’ll be part of a supportive student cohort that learns from one another and industry leaders.

Animals and plants are dying out, oceans are overfished and polluted, loggers cut down precious forests, and climate change is affecting the planet. Finding a way to live together and protect the environment could be our greatest challenge.\nEnvironmental policy, applied effectively, can stop this from happening through land and water management, carbon mitigation and adaptation, national parks, and new approaches to sustainable development. Environmental policy makers solve problems with the community and protect the environment for a better future. They protect vital ecosystems and stand between the environment and processes that degrade it.\nWhat will you do?\nOur Bachelor of Environmental Policy and Management challenges you to make a positive impact. You will:\nThere are also travel opportunities. We offer exchanges and study tours where you’ll tackle real-life problems in vulnerable communities.\nWhere could it take you?\nEnvironmental expertise is in demand. You could spend your days outdoors managing landscapes, engaging with communities, or drawing up plans for business and government. You might set up programs to restore habitats for local wildlife. Perhaps you’ll work towards sustainability in rangelands or urban communities, build policy around renewable energy, or get involved with ecotourism.Direct access to industry leaders and paid internship opportunities: The Academy by DeloitteThis degree gives you the opportunity to be part of our new The Academy by Deloitte. You’ll be part of a supportive student cohort that learns from one another and industry leaders. Formal and informal experiences will allow you to build relationships within the Deloitte network.\n^US News rankings of the Best Global Universities, 2022",

The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

It even informs our understanding of human behaviour.\nWhat will you do?\nExplore why cat’s meow, find out if parrots are smart, and play with the odd puppy or two as you build the skills to join this growing industry. You will:\nThere is also a strong practical element, with opportunities for industry experience, field work and study tours.\nWhere could it take you?\nYou could consult with exotic pets, prepare greyhounds for adoption or work in animal management for local government. You might ready dogs for roles guiding the visually impaired, detecting in customs, or even comforting children with autism and anxiety. Perhaps you’ll host your very own animal science show on TV.",

Economists look at society’s big picture, and give expert advice on policy design and business strategy.\nCombined, the two provide an all-inclusive view of markets, the economy and business. They come together in a wide range of rewarding and well-paid careers which you’ll be uniquely placed to pursue.\nWhat will you do?\nThis is a 4-year double, not combined degree. You’ll graduate with two separate parchments, a greater scope of career prospects and a competitive edge in the job market.\nFor more info\n^Accreditation Council for Entrepreneurial and Engaged Universities, 2017",

As humans, we are innately social, our lives revolve around connecting with others through eating, drinking, work and play. Speech pathologists help people of all ages to participate in their life and connect with others.\nTalented speech pathologists are already highly sought-after, and demand is growing fast.\nOur Bachelor of Speech Pathology (Honours) equips you to diagnose and treat conditions across the full scope of speech pathology practice; speech and language, swallowing, fluency, voice and multimodal communication. Our courses have an emphasis on inter-professional and culturally responsive practice and the degree facilitates the development of transferrable skills through real-world learning experiences.In over 800 hours of clinical based training, you’ll have the opportunity to work with children and adults of all ages in public and private health, community, disability, education and aged-care settings. With many of the courses taught by certified practicing speech pathologists, the degree places an emphasis on real-world experience.\nYou’ll gain high-level knowledge and skills in:\nYou’ll regularly access our purpose-built training facilities and state-of-the-art simulation suites—among Australasia’s most advanced. In addition, you’ll benefit from collaborative learning with key complementary disciplines: physiotherapy and occupational therapy.\nFrom late third year, you’ll choose one of two streams—research* or industry—and undertake a major project. Research will hone your skills in developing new knowledge; industry focuses on integrating research into practice.\nYou’ll graduate eligible to pursue a wide range of career opportunities. You could help children with disabilities or developmental delays connect with their peers by overcoming social communication challenges. You might help a person who has had a stroke regain their ability to eat and communicate, or support a patient in end of life care. Perhaps you’ll enable adults with acquired or traumatic brain injuries to communicate with others, or you may work as part of a therapeutic team working towards achieving the person’s goal of gaining employment.The Bachelor of Speech Pathology (Honours) is undertaking the Qualifying Accreditation process in accordance with the accreditation procedures of the national professional body, Speech Pathology Australia.\n*Entry into the research stream will be based on academic merit.Note: This degree is only available in blended mode and on-campus attendance is required.  If you are a continuing student in the degree and are unable to attend campus, please contact your program coordinator for program advice.",

Complex dental work contributes to this, but proper care and prevention are just as important.\nWhile dentists perform specialised treatments, oral health therapists have broad expertise in general oral health care and education.\nWhat will you do?\nOur Bachelor of Oral Health is an evidence-based degree that prepares you for providing general oral health care and health promotion. You will:\nWhere could it take you?\nYou will be part of providing high quality clinical care for all ages. You might develop hygiene maintenance programs for people managing chronic gum pain. You could advise on public health policy or design and implement educational campaigns. Perhaps you’ll open an oral health clinic with a team of oral health therapists and dentists you’re yet to meet at the University of Adelaide.  Note:This degree is only available in blended mode and on-campus attendance is required.  if you are a continuing student in the degree and are unable to attend campus, please contact your program coordinator for program advice.\n^ QS World University Ranking by Subject, 2022",

They are scientists, surgeons, carers, and lifelong learners.\nOur Bachelor of Science (Veterinary Bioscience) is ranked 49th in the world for veterinary sciences and has a Five Star Excellence in Research Australia ranking^.\nWhat will you do?\nYou’ll enjoy the smallest class size of any veterinary program in Australia. This means more personalised attention from our highly experienced teachers and researchers as you:\nWhere could it take you?\nThis is the first part of the veterinary science program. Graduates gain direct entry into the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program. Completing both degrees makes you eligible to register as a veterinarian, where you might own a practice or travel to farms around the country treating animals. Veterinary bioscience could also lead to roles in research in equine, zoo animal or wildlife medicine. You might even work in biosecurity, managing programs to prevent disease and pollution.\n*QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2022**Good Universities Guide – Veterinary Sciences, 2021 ^Excellence in Research for Australia, 2018",

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

The audition/interview will assess each applicant's current skill level and potential for future studies and offers will be made on the basis of the audition/interview score, academic achievement and the musicianship test. The Musicianship test aims to assess the applicant's general level of musicianship, which involves the ability to identify and recognise musical concepts within aural, written and theoretical contexts. The test comprises: aural questions covering rhythm, tonality, melody and harmony; score interpretation questions about a given short piano extract; theoretical questions such as keys, major and minor scales, intervals and chords.

They help us overcome injury, preserve physical condition during and after illness, and improve athletic performance.\nBut the psychological impact of that is far from purely technical; it’s a critical component of positive mental health and an enabler of a rewarding quality of life.\nOur Bachelor of Physiotherapy (Honours) equips you to assess and manage a range of health conditions.\nWith many courses taught by registered practising physiotherapists, the degree places an emphasis on real-world experience. In up to 900 hours of work-based training, you’ll work with children and adults of all ages in multiple settings which may include: public and private health organisations; schools; rehabilitation centres; sporting organisations; aged care and more.\nYou’ll gain high-level knowledge and skills in:\nYou’ll regularly access our purpose-built training facilities and state-of-the-art simulation suites—among Australasia’s most advanced. In addition, you’ll benefit from collaborative learning with key complementary disciplines, speech pathology and occupational therapy.\nFrom third year, you’ll choose one of two streams—research* or industry—and undertake a major project. Research will hone your skills in developing new knowledge; industry focuses on integrating research into practice.\nYou’ll graduate eligible to pursue a wide range of career opportunities. You could help cancer patients improve their condition—and spirit—during treatment. You could help a range of people better manage a variety of health conditions.

You might want to build the necessary foundations for postgraduate research. You could be seeking answers to questions no one else is asking in criminology. Perhaps you’re keen to develop deeper insight into emerging crime forms to gain an employability edge for the future.\nOur prerequisite for the Bachelor of Criminology (Honours) is a Distinction average in a Bachelor of Criminology or other bachelor degree with a Criminology major. Applications are called for in October and November each year.\n\nWhat will you do?\nFurther details on honours are available from schools and disciplines in the faculty.",

You might want to build a necessary foundation for postgraduate research at masters and doctorate levels. You could be seeking answers to environmental questions no one else has asked. Perhaps you’re pursuing advanced communication skills and subject knowledge to gain a competitive edge in the job market.\nOur prerequisite for honours study is at least a credit standard in a specified major. Applications are called for by Departments/Disciplines in October and November each year.\nWhat will you do?",

You might want to build the necessary foundations for postgraduate research at masters or doctorate levels. You could be seeking answers to economics questions no one else has asked. Perhaps you’re pursuing advanced skills for specialist positions in economics, including in government and business.\nWhat will you do?\nBrian Gray Scholarship Program\n\n^Accreditation Council for Entrepreneurial and Engaged Universities, 2017",

You might want to build the necessary foundations for postgraduate research. You could be seeking answers to questions no one else is asking in the media world. Perhaps you’re pursuing advanced creative and communication skills to gain a competitive edge in the industry.\nOur prerequisite for honours study is at least a credit standard in a specified major. Applications are called for by departments/disciplines in October and November each year.\nWhat will you do?\nWe also offer a creative practice pathway with a shorter written component. This pathway allows you to design and complete your own creative media project.\nFurther details on honours are available from schools and disciplines in the faculty.",

You might want to build a necessary foundation for postgraduate research. You could be seeking answers to international development questions no one else has asked. Perhaps you’re pursuing advanced communication skills and subject knowledge to gain a competitive edge in the job market.\nEntry into honours is selective and competitive.

You might want to build a necessary foundation for postgraduate research. You could be seeking answers to questions in international relations that no one else is asking. Perhaps you’re pursuing advanced communication skills and subject knowledge to gain a competitive edge in the job market.\nOur prerequisite for honours study is at least a credit standard in a specified major. Applications are called for by departments/disciplines in October and November each year.\nWhat will you do?\nFurther details on honours are available from schools and disciplines in the faculty.",

The statement must address three themes: - understanding of the role of a teacher - the personal and academic qualities possessed that will enable you to become an effective teacher - your attitude to learning Pathway students will be contacted directly by the university and asked to submit their statement at the end of their foundation program. Please note you may only submit one Teaching Capabilities Statement. Once you submit your statement you cannot make any changes or edits. Your submission will be final. All applicants must also attend and pass an audition/interview and a musicianship test. Selections for music programs are made on the basis of audition/interview scores combined with academic achievement and the musicianship test score. It is possible to audition for more than one instrument or study area if you have multiple interests. Auditions will be held in late November.

You might want to build the necessary foundations for postgraduate research. You could be seeking answers to questions no one else is asking in the sociology world. Perhaps you’re keen to develop deeper insight in an area of specialisation to gain an employability edge.\nOur prerequisite for the Bachelor of Sociology (Honours) is a Distinction average in a Bachelor of Sociology or other bachelor degree with a Sociology major. Applications are called for in October and November each year.\n\nWhat will you do?\nFurther details on honours are available from schools and disciplines in the faculty.\n\n\n*Top Universities, Ranking by subject, 2021",
