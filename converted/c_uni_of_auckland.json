Our hands-on programmes will equip you with the tools you need to teach in 21st century classrooms where building strong relationships is vital, diversity is welcomed and digital learning is key.\nOver the three years, you\u2019ll have dedicated blocks of time - up to a total of 24 weeks - that you'll spend full-time in a range of schools or kura. These placements are called practicum and allow you to gain a full picture of school life as you gradually take over full classroom responsibilites. While on practicum, you'll have the guidance of a dedicated teacher within the school, as well as support by your university supervisors. This will help you to become a part of a community, establish connections to set you up in your career, and gain vital skills to prepare you for the transition into teaching. Find out more information about practicum.\nThe programme is shaped by a commitment to fairness and social justice. It is underpinned by the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and a commitment to ensure equitable outcomes in learning. You will learn alongside a diverse range of students and be taught basic proficiency in te reo M\u0101ori.\nYou will be taught by academics who are experts in their fields of Education and passionate about supporting the next generation of teachers. Courses are taught through a range of methods including face-to-face lectures, tutorials and workshops, as well as online learning. Our tutorials are hands-on and provide a range of practical ideas and resources you can take onto practicum with you.\nBachelor of Education (Teaching) students are eligible for the external TeachNZ Scholarships. Applications are now open for the TeachNZ Career Changer scholarships.\u00a0Find out more and apply.\nBefore you begin your teaching journey, there are a few key steps you need to complete, so we recommend applying early.
