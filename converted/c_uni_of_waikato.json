Get the industry-relevant skills you need to become a communications specialist and digital storyteller using a wide range of technologies - from websites and apps through to films, podcasting and social media.\nWaikato's Bachelor of Communication offers a choice of five subject majors in Applied Digital Communication, Creative Media, Public Relations, Marketing, and Media Production.\nLearn how to create engaging multimedia content that helps people and organisations tell powerful stories in new ways, connect and engage with people, and communicate with purpose in the digital era.\nThis degree is an ideal choice if you\u2019re a creative thinker who enjoys expressing ideas and talking to people, you're interested in the latest social trends and digital technology, and you want to produce content that blends writing, film, images, sound and websites.\nOur graduates will be equipped with the versatile communication skills needed to launch exciting careers in a wide range of creative and media industries - marketing agencies, public relations, film and TV studios, web design, social media, gaming and virtual reality (VR), podcasting and mobile applications, and so much more. These kind of roles are available in private firms, central and local government, as well as not-for-profit community organisations.\nIn this degree, students will learn how to create digital communications that have the power to shape people\u2019s beliefs and behaviours; or seek to bring about meaningful social change.\nFor example, you could be asked by a client to run a publicity campaign around mental health services, spark wider discussion around government legislation, attract new customers to buy a company\u2019s new products/services, or help an organisation build trust and credibility. Which creative media tools should you harness to achieve this?\nFor this degree, you will gain expertise in one or more major subjects:\nApplied Digital Communication\nCreative Media\nMarketing\nMedia Production\nPublic Relations\nIn first year, the core papers of this degree will introduce you to the fundamentals of communication, marketing, public relations and the creative industries.\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to build and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders, and consider different perspectives when communicating across cultures.\nIn later years, you\u2019ll take more advanced papers focused on your major subject/s. For example, you could study web development, user experience design, transmedia storytelling, digital marketing, strategic brand management, film production, podcasting, interactive media design, events management, or PR campaigns.\nPractical industry experience\nIn third year, all BC students will complete a work-integrated learning paper called COMMS300 Communication Consulting Project. This is a great opportunity to gain practical industry experience by working on a real communication project for a host organisation.\nMajor and minor subjects\nAs part of this degree, you can opt to take a second major or 1-2 minors in almost any\u00a0undergraduate subject offered at the University of Waikato, such as Creative Writing, Digital Business, or Political Science. See below the degree planner for more suggestions.\nWhy study communication at Waikato?\nWaikato is ranked in the world's top 250 universities for Communication and Media Studies (QS World University Subject Rankings 2023).\nOur Bachelor of Communication is the only communication degree in New Zealand \u2013 and one of only five outside the United States - certified by the\u00a0Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). This is your guarantee of a world-class learning experience, as the PRSA sets the gold standard for PR education.\nWorld-leading alumni\nOur graduates are highly regarded by employers - their creative ideas can help small or large organisations to stand out in a crowded marketplace. You\u2019ll be following in the footsteps of prestigious Bachelor of Communication alumni such as former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Briar Thompson at Boston Consulting Group, Kym Bradbury at IKEA Group, and TVNZ journalist Lucas de Jong.", "url": "https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/qualifications/bachelor-of-communication", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["business", "computer", "HR"]}, {"university_name": "University of Waikato", "acronym": "Waikato", "world_ranking": 739, "address": "Hillcrest, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand", "province": "Hamilton", "country_code": "NZ", "geotag": ["east", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/TVsHrBZe9sTA732M8", "admission_email": "info@waikato.ac.nz", "phone_number": "+64 7 856 2889", "website_url": "https://www.waikato.ac.nz/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://calendar.waikato.ac.nz/admission/english-language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"Academic IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.0 (with no bands below 5.5)\"}, {\"testName\": \"iBT (Internet Based TOEFL)\", \"testMinScore\": \"80 with a Writing score of 21\"}, {\"testName\": \"TOEFL iBT Home-based\", \"testMinScore\": \"80 with a Writing score of 21\"}, {\"testName\": \"Certificate of Attainment in Academic English\", \"testMinScore\": \"B grade or better at Level 7\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE Academic\", \"testMinScore\": \"46 with no band less than 36\"}]}}", "course_name": "Diploma in Earth Sciences", "faculty": "School of Science", "program_length": "1 year", "education_level": "Diploma", "introduction": "A diploma is a short-term study option that can help pave your way to future success.", "url": "https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/qualifications/diploma/earth-sciences", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["science", "arts", "education"]}, {"university_name": "University of Waikato", "acronym": "Waikato", "world_ranking": 739, "address": "Hillcrest, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand", "province": "Hamilton", "country_code": "NZ", "geotag": ["east", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/TVsHrBZe9sTA732M8", "admission_email": "info@waikato.ac.nz", "phone_number": "+64 7 856 2889", "website_url": "https://www.waikato.ac.nz/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://calendar.waikato.ac.nz/admission/english-language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"Academic IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.0 (with no bands below 5.5)\"}, {\"testName\": \"iBT (Internet Based TOEFL)\", \"testMinScore\": \"80 with a Writing score of 21\"}, {\"testName\": \"TOEFL iBT Home-based\", \"testMinScore\": \"80 with a Writing score of 21\"}, {\"testName\": \"Certificate of Attainment in Academic English\", \"testMinScore\": \"B grade or better at Level 7\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE Academic\", \"testMinScore\": \"46 with no band less than 36\"}]}}", "course_name": "Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences with Honours (Creative Practices)", "faculty": "School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences", "program_length": "4.0 years", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "There will be no new enrolments into the BCMS(Hons) in 2023.

Get the industry-relevant skills you need to become a communications specialist and digital storyteller using a wide range of technologies - from websites and apps through to films, podcasting and social media.\nWaikato's Bachelor of Communication offers a choice of five subject majors in Applied Digital Communication, Creative Media, Public Relations, Marketing, and Media Production.\nLearn how to create engaging multimedia content that helps people and organisations tell powerful stories in new ways, connect and engage with people, and communicate with purpose in the digital era.\nThis degree is an ideal choice if you\u2019re a creative thinker who enjoys expressing ideas and talking to people, you're interested in the latest social trends and digital technology, and you want to produce content that blends writing, film, images, sound and websites.\nOur graduates will be equipped with the versatile communication skills needed to launch exciting careers in a wide range of creative and media industries - marketing agencies, public relations, film and TV studios, web design, social media, gaming and virtual reality (VR), podcasting and mobile applications, and so much more. These kind of roles are available in private firms, central and local government, as well as not-for-profit community organisations.\nIn this degree, students will learn how to create digital communications that have the power to shape people\u2019s beliefs and behaviours; or seek to bring about meaningful social change.\nFor example, you could be asked by a client to run a publicity campaign around mental health services, spark wider discussion around government legislation, attract new customers to buy a company\u2019s new products/services, or help an organisation build trust and credibility. Which creative media tools should you harness to achieve this?\nFor this degree, you will gain expertise in one or more major subjects:\nApplied Digital Communication\nCreative Media\nMarketing\nMedia Production\nPublic Relations\nIn first year, the core papers of this degree will introduce you to the fundamentals of communication, marketing, public relations and the creative industries.\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to build and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders, and consider different perspectives when communicating across cultures.\nIn later years, you\u2019ll take more advanced papers focused on your major subject/s. For example, you could study web development, user experience design, transmedia storytelling, digital marketing, strategic brand management, film production, podcasting, interactive media design, events management, or PR campaigns.\nPractical industry experience\nIn third year, all BC students will complete a work-integrated learning paper called COMMS300 Communication Consulting Project. This is a great opportunity to gain practical industry experience by working on a real communication project for a host organisation.\nMajor and minor subjects\nAs part of this degree, you can opt to take a second major or 1-2 minors in almost any\u00a0undergraduate subject offered at the University of Waikato, such as Creative Writing, Digital Business, or Political Science. See below the degree planner for more suggestions.\nWhy study communication at Waikato?\nWaikato is ranked in the world's top 250 universities for Communication and Media Studies (QS World University Subject Rankings 2023).\nOur Bachelor of Communication is the only communication degree in New Zealand \u2013 and one of only five outside the United States - certified by the\u00a0Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). This is your guarantee of a world-class learning experience, as the PRSA sets the gold standard for PR education.\nWorld-leading alumni\nOur graduates are highly regarded by employers - their creative ideas can help small or large organisations to stand out in a crowded marketplace. You\u2019ll be following in the footsteps of prestigious Bachelor of Communication alumni such as former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Briar Thompson at Boston Consulting Group, Kym Bradbury at IKEA Group, and TVNZ journalist Lucas de Jong.", "url": "https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/qualifications/bachelor-of-communication", "work_experience": "N/A", "ib_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "chinese_high_school_admission_info": {"applicationDeadline": "N/A", "requirements": "N/A"}, "important_tags": ["arts", "business", "HR"]}, {"university_name": "University of Waikato", "acronym": "Waikato", "world_ranking": 739, "address": "Hillcrest, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand", "province": "Hamilton", "country_code": "NZ", "geotag": ["east", "N/A"], "google_map_url": "https://goo.gl/maps/TVsHrBZe9sTA732M8", "admission_email": "info@waikato.ac.nz", "phone_number": "+64 7 856 2889", "website_url": "https://www.waikato.ac.nz/", "lang_req": "{\"url\": \"https://calendar.waikato.ac.nz/admission/english-language-requirements\", \"type\": {\"langTestType\": [{\"testName\": \"Academic IELTS\", \"testMinScore\": \"6.0 (with no bands below 5.5)\"}, {\"testName\": \"iBT (Internet Based TOEFL)\", \"testMinScore\": \"80 with a Writing score of 21\"}, {\"testName\": \"TOEFL iBT Home-based\", \"testMinScore\": \"80 with a Writing score of 21\"}, {\"testName\": \"Certificate of Attainment in Academic English\", \"testMinScore\": \"B grade or better at Level 7\"}, {\"testName\": \"PTE Academic\", \"testMinScore\": \"46 with no band less than 36\"}]}}", "course_name": "Bachelor of Health, Sport and Human Performance (Community Health)", "faculty": "Te Huataki Waiora - School of Health", "program_length": "3.0 years", "education_level": "Degree", "introduction": "The rapidly growing sport and leisure industry is worth over $12 billion a year to New Zealand.

Science (Technology) degree provides you with an opportunity to gain practical, relevant work experience as part of your undergraduate degree.\u00a0\u00a0This will help you to step into the professional world in your chosen career and successfully integrates theoretical learning with hands-on experience.\nThe BSc(Tech) is a flexible degree,\u00a0designed to provide you with the\u00a0necessary practical experience to stand\u00a0out among other science graduates.\nIt is internationally recognised,\u00a0meaning you can find work anywhere in\u00a0the world. A high percentage of graduates\u00a0actively seeking employment find it within six months of graduating.\nThis degree includes 10 weeks of\u00a0relevant work experience. The Cooperative Education Unit assists in matching students\u00a0with placement opportunities, and offering\u00a0reflective learning and skill development\u00a0after the placements are completed.\u00a0\u00a0Students are regularly offered permanent\u00a0roles following their placements.\nHeading into the workplace with a BSc(Tech)\u00a0from Waikato means you'll have spent the\u00a0summer between your second and third\u00a0years gaining relevant work experience and, in most\u00a0cases, being paid for your efforts.\nTo prepare you for the workplace and gain\u00a0an understanding of how the business\u00a0world works, the BSc(Tech) includes a workplace preparation paper prior to starting the work placement in addition to a wide\u00a0variety of science papers.\nThe first year of the degree is similar to\u00a0the BSc, enabling you to explore a range\u00a0of scientific disciplines, broaden your\u00a0opportunities and lay a foundation for you\u00a0to build on, even if you haven't studied\u00a0science before.\nFrom second year your major will form\u00a0the core of your degree and give you a\u00a0much deeper understanding of a particular\u00a0discipline.

These qualifications will help students to become innovative health leaders who can contribute to change in systems and practices to support equitable outcomes for individuals and their communities.\nFor M\u0101ori and indigenous peoples across the world, the sun is significant in health; knowledge; h\u0101uora; and m\u0101tauranga is immeasurable. The sun is light, life, health and promise, and pushes away darkness. Hence, in our M\u0101ori karakia we often say, \u201cka puta ki te ao m\u0101rama\u201d meaning to bring something into the world of light, to give it life.\nAt the University of Waikato we believe it is time to bring to light new ways of thinking about and practicing health in ways that address the growing inequities in the health system, through recognising the importance of hauora.*\nIn recognising the importance of preventative and holistic approaches to health, we need a workforce with knowledge of health service quality and equity that is built on a foundation of cultural competency, multidisciplinary knowledge, interpersonal and collaborative skills, applied biomedical skills, critical thinking, and regional and community engagement.\nThe Bachelor of Health has been specifically developed to address the growing demand for a workforce that can contribute across the health sector as this industry diversifies into roles with local governments, iwi, indigenous populations, community groups, private enterprise, individuals and families.\nThe BHealth is underpinned by the concept of hauora in practice and incorporates Biomedical Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physiology); Epidemiology; Bioethics; Health Communication and Community Approaches; M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous perspectives and practice; Psychology, Sociology, Policy; and Statistics, all of which allows students to explore the diverse aspects of health and wellbeing in applied and theoretical settings.\nOur graduates will have knowledge and skills that are practical and transferable, allowing them to practice in ways that exhibit an understanding of health as it relates to the individual, whanau and community. With a BHealth you will be well positioned to contribute to innovative approaches that address the complex health issues which matter to the different communities in New Zealand and internationally.\n*Hauora, as represented in this material, is defined as a holistic approach that values the interconnection between the physical and meta physical in ways that nourish and sustain the vitality of people and their communities.

Alternative options such as the BSc(Hons) in Computer Science are available to obtain a Bachelor's degree with Honours in Computer Science, Data Analytics, or Mathematics.\nThe Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (Honours) is New Zealand\u2019s only computing and mathematical science degree taught over four years. That extra year gives you the chance to drill more deeply into your specialist area and add papers that will complement your main focus.\nIf you enjoy tinkering with technology, designing new things and solving complex problems the Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (Honours) gives you the chance to explore many fields which are in high-demand.\nIn the BCMS(Hons) you can major in:\nComputer Science\nData Analytics\nMathematics\nFirst-year papers are common\u00a0across most Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (BCMS) majors which means you can try all in your first year. Because the first three years of the BCMS(Hons) are very similar to the\u00a0Bachelor of Science (BSc), you can choose when you graduate.

Which creative media tools should you harness to achieve this?\nFor this degree, you will gain expertise in one or more major subjects:\nApplied Digital Communication\nCreative Media\nMarketing\nMedia Production\nPublic Relations\nIn first year, the core papers of this degree will introduce you to the fundamentals of communication, marketing, public relations and the creative industries.\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to build and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders, and consider different perspectives when communicating across cultures.\nIn later years, you\u2019ll take more advanced papers focused on your major subject/s. For example, you could study web development, user experience design, transmedia storytelling, digital marketing, strategic brand management, film production, podcasting, interactive media design, events management, or PR campaigns.\nPractical industry experience\nIn third year, all BC students will complete a work-integrated learning paper called COMMS300 Communication Consulting Project. This is a great opportunity to gain practical industry experience by working on a real communication project for a host organisation.\nMajor and minor subjects\nAs part of this degree, you can opt to take a second major or 1-2 minors in almost any\u00a0undergraduate subject offered at the University of Waikato, such as Creative Writing, Digital Business, or Political Science.
