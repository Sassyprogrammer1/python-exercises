Embracing visual art alongside video, sound, interactivity, and performance, our program pushes and challenges the limits of how to approach sculpture as a material practice.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nInterdisciplinary, experimental, and progressive, Sculpture + Expanded Practices is for visual artists and spatial thinkers who want to work with their hands across sculptures, installations, public art, and more.\nThrough your studio-led courses, taught by leading visual artists, you'll gain essential technical grounding in wood, metal, mould-making and casting, flexible materials, textiles + soft sculpture, and digital fabrication. From site-specific work to constructed objects, you'll experiment with both traditional and non-traditional media, including video, digital media, and kinetics. As your studies progress, you'll have the flexibility to take more advanced courses in the areas of your choice.\nWhile most of your time will be spent working with these machines and materials, you'll also be assigned theoretical readings, and participate in group discussions and presentations. Expect to be immersed in a caring and diverse student body, where you and your peers will support each other as both artists and citizens.\nThrough your courses, led by renowned artists, you'll not only learn and hone your skills, but you'll also be able to situate your own practice in relation to social themes, communities, and contemporary styles. Upon graduation, you'll have produced an impressive body of work that will prepare you for professional roles in the arts.",

Here, you'll create your own academic pathway as you discover your strengths and interests as a visual artist. As you build your creative skills, you'll develop a deep understanding of how various art forms connect and intersect, and the history that informs today's practices.\nYour faculty members, practicing artists who define the Canadian creative landscape, will guide you as you refine your techniques and follow your curiosity. After graduating, you'll have a mature and exceptional body of work to launch your career in visual arts.",

From digital to the darkroom, photography encompasses so much more than the camera\u2014and sometimes, it doesn't even involve a camera at all.\nThe world of photography is rapidly evolving. In order to thrive, students need both practical and theoretical skills. This program is uniquely designed to equip students with just that, blending studio and classroom-based studies.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nMultidisciplinary and innovative, the Photography major provides both knowledge and hands-on skills in a range of analogue and digital processes. Through art history, research, and critical courses, you'll study the work of historical and contemporary photographers and artists.\nIn both the classroom and your studio courses, you'll also have the opportunity to investigate how photography relates to other mediums, including installation, video, performance, printmaking, and directorial work.\nYou'll take a variety of approaches to the photograph as an object, and work in diverse environments, from studio shoots to street photography. You'll learn from renowned, professional photographers, hone your photography skills, and establish your own relationship to the art form.\nBoth your conceptual and hands-on learning will be strengthened through classes, seminars, self-directed projects, exhibitions, and professional development. Upon graduating, you'll have produced a substantial body of work and gained advanced knowledge of its place within contemporary photography practices.",

Whether you dream of becoming a cinematographer, director, set designer, sound designer, or editor, the FMSA program will prepare you for your future as a visual storyteller.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nThe primary focus of Film + Screen Arts is practical, studio-based learning. You'll also take a robust and diverse selection of critical and cultural studies courses. Through both your hands-on and theoretical courses, you'll gain the skills and insights to produce film, video, media installation, sound, and other works at a professional level.\nAs you progress through your studies, you'll learn core technical and organizational competencies, and produce your own film and media projects both individually and collaboratively. In your third year of studies, you'll participate in intensive conceptual work, deepening your knowledge of film history and contexts. You'll also have the opportunity to take an internship course, either at ECU through positions with faculty, or with companies and organizations in Vancouver's thriving film industry.\nThe program culminates in your fourth year with a capstone project, where you'll produce a piece of work over a longer period of time, allowing for reflection and change throughout development, production, editing, and completion. You'll have opportunities to display and distribute this project by submitting to festivals, galleries, exhibitions, and web-oriented events. Most importantly, you'll graduate with an impressive body of work that will prepare you for further professional and artistic pursuits.\nAlong the way, you'll develop your unique creative voice and use film and screen arts to engage with social and political issues. Students benefit from a supportive peer network, extensive mentoring, and one-on-one support from our accomplished faculty of professional and award-winning filmmakers.",
