During studio classes and seminars, your teachers will show you how to take an experimental approach to design that encourages creative and thoughtful design solutions.\nYou'll major in one of eight areas\u2014Animation and Visual Effects, Communication Design, Design for Social Innovation, Fashion Design Technology, Game Design, Industrial Design, Interaction Design, or Media Design. A feature of this degree is that it's cross-disciplinary, meaning you'll be encouraged to study and work in subject areas outside Design.
