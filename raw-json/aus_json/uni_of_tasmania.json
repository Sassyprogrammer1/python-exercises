Our goal is to embed design within the working fabric of the state, to realise a design-led Tasmania. We believe that design expands beyond objects and interfaces, to interactions and systems.With renowned designers, creative people, inspiring places and events on your doorstep, Tasmania is the ideal place to study design.Design permeates every aspect of our lives, we embrace the complexity that it entails. Our design courses will expand your understanding of the world as you learn how to create positive impacts through design. Discover how to inspire others to tell their stories, learn to visualise complex information and data, undertake research and prototyping to meet community needs, or design events and experiences that inspire those around you.The Bachelor of Design offers the greatest flexibility, with the opportunity to take up to three complete design streams, a second major from another discipline, or even a double degree.Core Design Studio units emphasise hands-on learning through collaboration with peers, designers and external stakeholders and the creative development and application of knowledge and skills from your selected design streams in a variety of contexts and project briefs.Combined with design thinking, visualisation and knowledge of design history and ethics, and the opportunity to develop your own projects in the final year, you will graduate with transferable skills that open diverse career pathways in a huge range of industries. The Bachelor of Design also offers a pathway to post-graduate study through Honours and PhD.",

You will be engaging in the contemporary practices of art, which, while still firmly having making at their centre, also engage with the world through critical and reflective thinking.In one year of advanced practice-led study, you will have the option of undertaking either Professional Honours or Research Honours, depending on your results and your future aims. Professional Honours focuses on developing skills required for engaging in creative practices outside the university setting, while Research Honours prepares you for undertaking a Research Higher Degree such as an MFA or a PhD.You will present a conceptually multi-layered, resolved creative work as a result of a project in the disciplines of visual art, design or theatre and performance. We are developing opportunities for our students to participate in contemporary culture, not to just be consumers of it - to actively contribute to the cultural life of our society. You will be able to engage directly with Tasmania’s internationally acclaimed arts culture through our ongoing partnerships with festivals and arts institutions across the state and interact with both Australian and international visiting artists.A degree in creative arts can be the foundation of a surprising variety of careers, as it develops the generally agreed essential 21st century skills of criticality, creativity, innovation and communication; the only limits are in your imagination.",

At the same time, it is fast being displaced, degraded and destroyed. An ability to think critically and creatively across disciplines, in the intersection between nature and human society, is vital for informing the management, protection, and use of the natural environment. People with this knowledge will work to protect and restore nature on our one planet.There is no better place to study natural environments and wilderness than Tasmania. Our state is a living laboratory, with a fifth of it in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Areas, and 42% in protected areas, many of which are close to our campus doors. Tasmania also offers a vibrant variety of urban, social, and rural environments to engage with, learn from, and live amongst.This wide, interdisciplinary degree will enable you to contribute your skills and experience to a wide variety of occupations in a wide variety of places. Every nation, regardless of their level of development, has a natural environment which must be managed and protected.Catalyst ProgramAre you a high achiever and want to get the most out of your University experience?

People who are motivated to become the thought and action leaders of the future, who want to embrace the world around them, expand their university experience to include multi-disciplinary perspectives, and affect positive change wherever their future careers take them.It’s a degree built of your choosing that you generally study in parallel with your principal degree, with unit options covering research, leadership and service, cultural understanding, and multidisciplinary perspectives. There is a particular focus on transferable, multidisciplinary skills, and cultural engagement, with many units breaking the classroom/exam tradition and providing you the option to undertake projects within local, state, national or even international communities.As a true high achiever reward program, domestic students who qualify for this program currently also receive a full HECS scholarship, meaning you can get a second degree full of amazing and enriching experiences for no extra cost while you complete your main degree.For further information on the BPhil, please contact the Course Coordinator on B.Phil@utas.edu.au.",

Research is demonstrating ways in which music, visual arts, theatre and other creative arts can contribute to addressing these challenges.The Diploma of Creative Arts and Health offers you an interdisciplinary study experience that is unique. You will gain knowledge of innovative uses of creative arts in a range of community and health-care settings, while developing an understanding of the effects of the arts on brain and body in the social and cultural context.  There are opportunities to explore your own creativity and learn about international best practice for ethical and effective implementation of arts programmes in both community and healthcare settings.If you are interested in how the power of creative arts can be used to promote wellbeing and better health in a range of community and healthcare settings - then this course is for you!Pay for uni later with a HELP loan Costs should never get in the way of university. If you’re an eligible domestic student, you can take advantage of an interest-free loan from the Government, which means you can pay your tuition fees later. This is called a HELP loan. There are a few different options, but the most common are called HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP.To apply for a HELP loan, you need to submit an application. You will receive instructions on how to do that after you accept your course offer. Find out more at When to pay your fees.",
