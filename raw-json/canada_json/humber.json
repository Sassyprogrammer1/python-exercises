Infrastructure encompasses all of the essential elements necessary for society to operate including buildings, transportation (highways and transit), municipal services (water, wastewater) and green spaces.\nThe curriculum, designed in collaboration with industry, covers all aspects of infrastructure, from the inception of an idea to the completion of construction, and blends in-class academic learning with hands-on laboratory work. You will learn how to design structural steel, reinforced concrete and timber structures. Municipal services (water, wastewater) and water supply management will be explored. Transportation infrastructure and highway design will be studied using design codes and standards. Additionally, you will learn all the skills necessary to support design and construction including surveying, geomatics, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), drafting (AutoCAD and Building Information Modelling (BIM)), soils and materials testing, project administration and management, and environmental protection and remediation. Our courses are taught by experienced faculty and industry experts many of whom work with Greater Toronto Area construction and engineering firms. Humber’s strong reputation in the civil engineering industry can give graduates an edge in the employment market.",

Students are encouraged to critically analyze systemic issues, develop and apply skills in counselling, case management, community development and grant writing.  \nCourses in the first year are part of the common platform with other degrees at Humber offered in the field of social science. In the second year of study, students immerse themselves in the field of addictions and mental health in courses that include equity and inclusion, assessment, and counselling. This solid foundation of theory and application is followed by two years of further in-depth study in ethics, advanced counselling, contemporary issues, inter-professional collaboration and research. Overall, the program emphasizes critical thinking, analytical skills, leadership/management and professional practice.",

These skills are then applied to product launches, planning merchandise assortments, styling fashion shoots and the production of fashion events.\nOur advisory committee provides regular review and input of curriculum ensuring our program is always on the cutting edge of industry developments.\nIn the first year, courses in the business of fashion – marketing strategies, product knowledge, trend forecasting and web merchandising – give students an overview of this multibillion-dollar industry. In the second year, students build on the skills developed on the foundation with wholesale sales, retail buying and operation, photo styling, and event planning and budgeting.",

            "introduction": "Humber’s Construction Engineering Technology program is one of three stackable programs within the Carpentry-Construction group. Along with the Carpentry and Renovation Techniques certificate and the Building Construction Technician diploma, the program introduces you to the carpentry trade and commercial project management while giving you practical experience with trade regulations, commercial construction techniques and estimating. Students will be able to move from various certificate and diploma programs into the advanced diploma program (including Carpentry and Renovation Technician, Industrial Woodworking Technician, Carpentry and Renovation Techniques, and Building Construction Technician).  \nThis program is designed to explore the construction industry from an engineering and management perspective. You will become familiar with the strategies required for project planning and execution for the commercial-based industry.\nThroughout the program, you will learn about compliance with workplace health and safety practices and procedures in accordance with legislation and regulations. You will also learn how to ensure that work is performed in compliance with contractual obligations, applicable laws, standards, bylaws, codes and ethical practices. Coursework will include sustainability practices. Teamwork, leadership, and supervisory and interpersonal skills will be emphasized.\nKey learnings will include:\n\ncollecting, processing, analyzing and co-ordinating technical data to produce project-related documents\nco-ordinating and facilitating the collecting, processing, interpreting and application of survey/geomatics and layout information\nmonitoring projects through principles of construction project management\nperforming, co-ordinating and facilitating quality control testing\npreparing estimates\nselecting and using industry-specific technologies\n\nOptional Co-op\nThis program offers a co-op option. Co-op work terms enable you to apply your skills and knowledge in a work environment and gain valuable, practical experience related to your program of study. You will learn new skills, learn about the world of work and meet people in your profession.\nFor students who are accepted into the program, two co-op work terms will take place. The first four-month work term is between Semesters 2 and 3, and the second four-month work term is between Semesters 4 and 5. There are limited spaces in the co-op option. Therefore, during Semester 1, you will be provided with information about the application process and will be able to apply to the co-op stream at that time. While co-op work opportunities are not guaranteed, as students are in a competitive job placement market, participating students will receive a wide range of services to help them find a co-op opportunity.",

The program is based on the professional practice of child and youth care supported by the disciplines of psychology, sociology, community development, political science and education. The curriculum focuses on the theory and research of relational practice: building relationships to support children and youth in crisis or going through experiences of challenge and change.\nYou’ll learn from highly qualified professors, as well as from guest lecturers from the field of child and youth care or community members with lived experiences. You’ll have the unique opportunity to develop key practice skills through faculty supervision in our state-of-the-art interview labs, and our therapeutic play lab designed as a children’s activity room and space to support family practice.\nYour courses integrate the study of developmental, preventative and therapeutic approaches in child and youth care and will teach you direct practice methods such as interviewing and counselling, responding to abuse, therapeutic play, and other intervention modalities taught from a strength-based perspective and within a caring, anti-oppressive and anti-racist framework.\nThe first two years of the program provide you with a comprehensive understanding of child and youth development, as well as current methodologies in child and youth care professional practice. In the final two years, you will be able to engage in courses related to five areas of concentration – youth justice and advocacy, social policy and research, approaches to care, community development and youth engagement, and international perspectives. The curriculum and work-integrated learning experiences throughout the program will support you to select a focus for your final thesis project in fourth year.",

The program is firmly grounded in the theory, principles and practices of behavioural science (applied behaviour analysis and cognitive behavioural approaches) and psychology. Applied behavioural analysis uses behavioural rules in everyday situations to help people change their behaviour to improve quality of life. The program focuses on data obtained through observation as it investigates behaviour, cognitive events and the influence of environmental factors on behaviour.\nCourses in the first two years of the program provide a strong foundation in behaviour analytic approaches, psychology, research and ethics while highlighting specific special populations. This is followed in the final two years by further in-depth study of ethics and professionalism, individual and group counselling, issues in behavioural psychology, further special populations, and two courses of senior thesis work. Overall, the program emphasizes critical thinking, analytical skills, interprofessional practice and leadership.",

Supported by a faculty team with diverse researching and in-field experiences, the curriculum combines both theory and applied practice to provide an interdisciplinary and lived experience for learners. Emphasis is strongly placed on exploring systemic discriminations of crime and the experiences of marginalized groups, psychological understandings of offending, and current social justice issues.\nIn the first year of study, students participate in a social science foundational year with their peers from the Faculty of Social  Community Services. In years two through four, the curriculum has a criminal justice focus. Knowledge and critical skills will be developed through collaborative group projects and presentations to help prepare for a variety of fast-paced and dynamic work settings within the justice field. Students will also complete a work-integrated learning credit (offered part-time or full-time). This networking opportunity fosters the development of practical skills among our learners.\nHumber’s multidisciplinary teaching approach emphasizes critical thinking, analytical, organizational, research and strong writing skills. These are combined with the development of professional skills including communication, interpersonal skills, conflict management, problem solving, team building and leadership.",

Students solve real industry and community problems and gain knowledge and skills in civil, architectural, structural and environmental engineering. These abilities are in high demand as industry explores the use of innovative and resilient technologies and processes to make the construction of buildings and communities safer, more efficient and sustainable.\nStudents use digital design applications and data capture technologies such as 3D scanning and mapping to integrate new and sustainable elements of the built environment into existing buildings, communities and cities. Virtual and augmented reality complement a design thinking approach to solving real world problems.",

            "introduction": "Humber’s Bachelor of Engineering program begins with a common platform of first year courses which provide foundational engineering knowledge and skills. Following the first year, the curriculum branches into three different discipline areas: Information Systems Engineering, Mechatronics, and The Built Environment.  \nThe Bachelor of Engineering – Mechatronics discipline gives you hands-on experience with industry-standard advanced technology. You can choose from focused study in either robotics or embedded systems. During the course of the program, students will solve real industry and community problems and gain knowledge and skills in mechanical, electrical, electronics and computer engineering. Students use emerging and cutting edge technologies in robotics, control, electronics, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), motors, mechanical components, digital and analog circuits, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), machine learning, modelling, simulation, embedded systems, and advanced manufacturing. Each of these themes provides theoretical knowledge alongside hands-on training to complement a systems-thinking approach to solving real world problems. \nIn addition, this program provides an opportunity to work on industry-led projects through multidisciplinary capstone projects as well as applied research opportunities. Through these experiences, students apply the theoretical knowledge gained during their education to solve real industry problems, while improving their professional skills such as teamwork, communication, collaboration and problem-solving. \nThis program is also offered at Sault College in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Students in the program will collaborate on activities using technology that will involve simultaneous learning at both colleges.",

Our graduates problem-solve, investigate and explore design environments where people thrive.\nEngaging interior design studios enable you to master an evidence-based design process, develop effective presentation abilities and acquire vital professional practice skills. Team collaboration among student groups mirrors industry team practices.\nObservational field trips provide opportunities for you to connect classroom theory, such as the perception of space and human interaction, with built environments. In the fourth year, you will engage with industry mentors to research, develop and document a large scale interior design project from initial concept to construction documentation.\nAdditionally, a self-directed volunteer project helps connect your passion for design to the community and the design industry. Students have worked with organizations such as the Toronto District School Board, The Naval Reserves, Habitat for Humanity, and youth and women’s shelters.",

In addition, instruction in fitness and lifestyle management will teach you about the importance of health and wellness, as well as the fitness component of the Constable Selection Process.  \nYour professors, who have work experience in the justice, policing, public safety and community service sector, will help you graduate with a range of security, problem-solving and administrative skills, and with a commitment to social justice and service to your community. \nGraduates of the program will be subject to all requirements of the Ontario Constable Selection Process and local police requirements when applying for a position as a police constable in Ontario. \nWhile the program does not offer a work placement, self-initiated community service opportunities will be made available to help broaden your understanding of the role of justice services within the community at large. In Semester 4, students have the option to apply for the opportunity to participate in the Career Mentorship Program. Selected students will be matched to an expert working in the field of policing. Upon successful completion of the Career Mentorship Program, students will be awarded recognition on their co-curricular record. This is an optional component of the program.\nThe Police Foundations program is also offered part time.",

Meeting these challenges means buildings, energy systems and infrastructure must evolve – yesterday’s solutions are being replaced by new approaches. Our Sustainable Energy and Building Technology advanced diploma program positions graduates with a portfolio of skills that are in high demand.\nOur unique program prepares graduates to examine, model and improve the energy and environmental performance of existing buildings; to support the design, construction and operation of new, sustainable buildings being built to increasingly stringent performance standards; to implement renewable energy technologies; and to support new approaches to understanding and managing energy use and building resilience into campuses, neighbourhoods or entire cities. At one time we paid little attention to the cost, availability or environmental impact of energy use – today, these are issues of growing importance to individuals, business and government.",

A full understanding of art and design theories will help you draw, visualize and apply colour principles to create appealing work. You will also gain a mastery in adhering to a pipeline as you develop content across courses. Teamwork is also emphasized as you collaborate with students from other programs to better simulate a studio/production environment.​\nLearn to go beyond beautiful surfaces and moving objects to get to the heart of 3D art and animation — involving narratives that capture the imagination of your audience.​",

            "introduction": "Humber’s Bachelor of Digital Communications degree program explores the dynamic media environment and the cultural, social, economic and political implications of digital innovation. Communications studies are becoming recognized as one of the most significant social sciences in the 21st century. Increasingly, worldviews are shaped through messages received from television, film, the internet, social media and a host of media arts, with profound impacts on how the world and the self are viewed. The construction of everyday lives and identities are negotiated through digital media and social networks which influence how we live, the products we produce and consume, and how we connect.\nThis program is rigorous and innovative, developing digital storytellers who are skilled in writing, visual communication, web applications and social media. You will build business acumen while working in an environment where creative ideas and methods cross-pollinate. As you gain technical competency, you will collaborate and innovate with peers, faculty and visitors, building personal communication and networking skills. Intensive lectures and labs provide direction and practical experience, sharpening technical skills and stimulating critical discourse, using student work as a starting point. Access to equipment and computing spaces enables reflective and collaborative project work. Historical, legal, ethical and theoretical considerations are built into the creative process.\nAs part of the program, you will take courses that deepen your awareness of your roles as a citizen conscious of the social, political, environmental and cultural contexts of your work. As a senior student in this program, you will specialize in advanced communication theory and techniques. A culminating capstone project showcases your abilities and learning and serves as a platform for launching a career in social media co-ordination and management, digital content creation, media relations and many other mass communications fields. Graduates may also choose to further their studies at the master’s level.",

            "introduction": "Humber’s award-winning Multimedia Design and Development diploma program offers the opportunity to participate in an extensive multimedia design education where students build a range of interactive digital media production skills including web design, mobile interface design, experience design, motion graphics, 2D animation, web coding, streaming, user testing, video and sound editing, user interface prototyping, digital storytelling, and interactive design. Through this hands-on learning process, students will develop the fundamental creative and technical multimedia design and development capabilities needed to pursue a career in user experience (UX) design, user interface (UI) design, product design, videography, motion graphics, and front-end development. \nMultimedia Design and Development is one of two programs within Humber’s interaction and design common platform cluster. The first semester of this program is shared with the three-year Graphic Design program. This offers students exposure to the different areas of programming, common elements of design and creative thinking, and collaborative work with students studying to work in complementary career fields. Greater exposure to the ever-evolving exciting world of design and development will allow students to investigate the edges of this area of study, and then students will confirm their focus prior to the second semester of study.  \nUnder the guidance of experienced and knowledgeable professors, students learn on and become experienced with industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, XD, Audition and Premiere. Web technologies such as HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS and MongoDB are employed in hands-on learning situations in our applied teaching environment with relevant industry projects. \nStudents cultivate important collaborative teamwork and project management skills through group assignments both within this program and through interdisciplinary work with students in sister programs. This prepares students for collaborative projects in the field and helps students gain a real-world perspective on the nature of multimedia work. Students prepare to pursue new media opportunities by developing a comprehensive portfolio that they can present to potential employers or clients, and they are exposed to entrepreneurial opportunities open to professionals in this rich field. Students in this program also build real-world user experience skills using Humber’s unique, mobile usability lab and through a work placement.",

            "introduction": "You’re smart. That’s a good start. Also funny and creative. You’ve been called “talented.” You do stuff like write, draw, paint, design posters, dance, play music, DJ, take cool photos, do stand-up comedy, shoot your own videos, create animated GIFs. You like to make things and get stuff done. You’re the one who organizes the stage crew and the Talent Night. Maybe you’ve already done some other study – anthropology, English, history, psychology, graphic design, photography. And you’re wondering: “Can I make a career out of any of this?”\nWe certainly think so. How about art director, copywriter, strategist, or account executive in the world of advertising – probably the most fun business you can be in while actually being paid (well) to be creative.\nIn Humber’s Bachelor of Creative Advertising program, you’ll work hard. You’ll get a lot of depth and theory, but you’ll do even more hands-on work that puts that theory to real-world use. You'll build skills you never knew you had. You’ll have fun. You’ll meet lifelong friends and creative collaborators who will become the core of your future professional network. You’ll mix and work with industry professionals, build a killer portfolio, and launch your career with a 14-week internship – probably at one of the better agencies in the country.\nThe program provides a unique, 360-degree education in the key aspects of modern advertising: art direction, copywriting, account management and creative strategy. Over the four years of the degree, this allows you to discover your own particular creative strengths and identify your ideal career path while working in industry-standard teams and learning how to develop powerful, effective advertising campaigns.\nAt its core, the Bachelor of Creative Advertising program is designed to build future industry leaders, and we do. Our award-winning alumni work on major brands, and many of them now hold senior positions in top Canadian and international ad agencies.",

The program continues to evolve to meet our students’ unique needs and those of the industry. Our students are in demand by employers across the country and beyond.\nWhat sets PRD apart is the common first semester which exposes students to complementary communications disciplines in their first semester of study: advertising, marketing, graphic design and journalism. Students can remain in PRD or move into another area of study if they choose.\nPRD prepares students for this demanding, deadline-driven career through foundational courses and practical, hands-on experience. As students move into the following semesters, the focus is on creating and executing effective communications strategies through a selection of tactics that resonate with the target audiences. Full-time faculty and part-time instructors (who continue to work in the industry) assist students to hone their skills in practical courses in four PR Writing Labs, strategic communications planning, social and digital media content development/analytics, media relations, research, PR agency, public affairs and issues/crisis management. The successful completion of this course work culminates in an internship.",
